<br /><i>ABOARD THE GOODTIME</i></h2>
<p>A blanket of fog, thick and damp, swirled about
the decks of the excursion steamer, <i>Goodtime</i>, cautiously
plying its course down the river. At intervals,
above the steady throb of the ship&rsquo;s engines, a fog
horn sounded its mournful warning to small craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t collide with another boat before
we make the dock,&rdquo; remarked Louise Sidell who stood
at the railing with her chum, Penelope Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a perfect ending for an imperfect
day,&rdquo; returned Penny, fitting her coat collar more
snugly about her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An imperfect day! I call it a miserable one. Rain
and fog! Rain and fog! It&rsquo;s made my hair as straight
as the shortest distance between two points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s as kinky as wool.&rdquo; Impatiently Penny
brushed a ringlet of golden hair from her eyes. &ldquo;Well,
shall we go inside again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather freeze than be a wallflower,&rdquo; the
dark-eyed girl responded gloomily. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been
asked to dance once this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because we came without our own crowd,
Lou. Except for that couple yonder, we&rsquo;re practically
the only persons aboard unattached to a group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny jerked her head in the direction of a young
man and girl who slowly paced the deck. Earlier in
the evening their peculiar actions had attracted her
attention. They kept strictly to themselves, avoiding
the salon, the dining room, and all contact with other
excursionists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who they are?&rdquo; mused Louise, turning
to stare. &ldquo;The girl wears a veil as if she were afraid
someone might recognize her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I noticed that, and whenever anyone goes
near her, she lowers her head. I wish we could see her
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wander over that way,&rdquo; proposed Louise.</p>
<p>Arm in arm, they sauntered toward the couple. The
young man saw them coming. He touched his companion&rsquo;s
arm and, turning their backs, they walked
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did that to avoid meeting us!&rdquo; Louise declared
in an excited undertone. &ldquo;Now why, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>The couple had reached the end of the deck. As
the young woman turned to glance over her shoulder,
a sudden gust of wind caught her hat. Before she
could save it, the head-gear was swept dangerously
close to the railing.</p>
<p>Not giving the young man an opportunity to act,
Penny darted forward. Rescuing the hat, she carried
it to the couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the girl mumbled, keeping her head
lowered. &ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly she jammed the felt hat on her head and
replaced the veil, but not before Penny had seen her
face clearly. The young woman was unusually pretty
with large brown eyes and a long, smoothly brushed
black bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly a miserable night,&rdquo; Penny remarked,
hoping to start a conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; replied the young man with discouraging
brevity.</p>
<p>He tipped his hat and steered his companion away
from the girl.</p>
<p>Ruefully Penny returned to Louise who had been
an interested spectator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get a good look at the pair?&rdquo; she asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;ve never seen either of them before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and the girl lowered her veil as soon as she
could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s a movie actress traveling in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboard a river excursion boat? I&rsquo;m afraid not,
Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe she&rsquo;s a criminal trying to elude the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear the mystery of her identity must remain forever
unsolved,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll dock in another
five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the fog could be seen a dim glow of lights
along the Riverview wharf. The <i>Goodtime</i>, its whistle
tooting repeated signals, was proceeding more slowly
than ever. Sailors stood ready to make the vessel fast
to the dock posts when she touched.</p>
<p>Passengers began to pour from the salon, and Penny
and Louise joined the throng. Many persons pushed
and jostled each other, trying to obtain a position
close to the gangplank.</p>
<p>Suddenly a girl who stood not far from Penny gave
an alarmed cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pocketbook! It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those near her expressed polite concern and assisted
in searching the deck. The missing purse was
not found. Before the captain could be notified, the
gangplank was lowered, and the passengers began to
disembark from the steamer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>The girl, whose pocketbook had been lost, remained
by the railing, quite forgotten. Tears streamed down
her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Penny, addressing her, &ldquo;is there
anything I can do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disconsolately, the girl shook her head. She made a
most unattractive picture, for her blouse was wrinkled
and her skirt was spotted with an ugly coffee stain.
Beneath a brown, misshapen roll-brim hat hung a
tangle of brown hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone stole my pocketbook,&rdquo; she said listlessly.
&ldquo;I had twelve dollars in it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you didn&rsquo;t leave it anywhere?&rdquo; Louise
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had it in my hand only a minute ago. I think
someone lifted it in the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pickpocket, no doubt,&rdquo; Penny agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
told they frequent these river boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly everyone has left the steamer now, so I
suppose it would do no good to notify the captain,&rdquo;
commented Louise.</p>
<p>She and Penny started to turn away, then paused as
they noticed that the girl remained in the same dejected
posture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have friends meeting you at the boat?&rdquo; Penny
inquired kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any friends&mdash;not in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None?&rdquo; Penny asked in surprise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you live
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working as a
waitress at Flintville, up-river. The job played out last
week. Today I took this boat, thinking I might find
work in Riverview. Now I&rsquo;ve lost my purse and I
don&rsquo;t know what to do or where to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any money?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cent. I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to sleep in the park
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Penny. Impulsively, she
opened her own purse and, removing a five dollar bill,
thrust it into the girl&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t much, but it
may tide you over until you can find work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re kind to help me. I&rsquo;ll pay you back just
as soon as I get a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;However,
I should like to know your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie Fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is Penelope Parker and my friend is Louise
Sidell. Well, good luck in finding that job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edging away from Tillie who would have detained
them indefinitely, the girls crossed the gangplank to
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were generous to give a stranger five dollars,
Penny,&rdquo; commented Louise when they were beyond
hearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she needed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your allowance money, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t allow the girl to go hungry or
sleep in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; replied Louise.</p>
<p>Penny paused, scanning the crowd on the dock.
Her father, Anthony Parker, had promised to meet the
excursion boat, but there was no sign of him or his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad must have been detained at the newspaper
office,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I suppose we must wait here
until he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing themselves from the stream of traffic, the
girls walked a short distance along the dock, halting
beside a warehouse. The throng rapidly dispersed, and
still Mr. Parker did not arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we haven&rsquo;t missed him,&rdquo; Penny remarked
anxiously. &ldquo;In this fog one can&rsquo;t see many yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had waited only a few minutes longer when
Louise suddenly touched her chum&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, there she is! Alone, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that girl whose hat you recovered on the
<i>Goodtime</i>. See her coming this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned to stare at the young woman who was
walking hurriedly along the dock. At first glance she
was inclined to agree with Louise that it was the same
girl, then she was uncertain. The one who approached
wore an expensive fur and carried a distinctive beaded
bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I ever saw her before,&rdquo; she commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I was mistaken,&rdquo; admitted Louise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
too well dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the girl did not observe Penny and her
chum, for she passed them without a glance. Hurriedly
she walked a short distance down the wharf. Then,
with a deft movement, she took a package from beneath
her smart-fitting coat, and tossed it into the
water.</p>
<p>Turning, she retraced her steps to the gangplank
of the <i>Goodtime</i>. A moment later the girls saw her
meet a young man in topcoat and derby who had
emerged from the crowd on the dock. Entering a gray
sedan, they drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she threw into the river?&rdquo; mused
Penny. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think she acted as if she were
afraid someone would see her, Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. Whatever it was, it&rsquo;s gone to the bottom
of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously the girls walked to the edge of the dock.
Penny glanced over the side and gave an excited cry.
Instead of falling into the water, the package had
caught fast on a jagged dock post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hanging by the string!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Eagerly Louise peered down. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; she
agreed. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pleaded Louise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far down.
You&rsquo;ll tumble into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you sit on my heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Undisturbed by what anyone who saw her might
think, Penny stretched flat on the dock. With Louise
holding to her, she jack-knifed over the edge, clutching
at the bundle which dangled an inch above the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Haul away, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise pulled her friend to safety. Eagerly they
examined the package which was wrapped in ordinary
newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture it contains nothing more than the remains
of a lunch,&rdquo; declared Louise. &ldquo;This is going to
be a good joke on you, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke?&rdquo; quavered Penny.</p>
<p>Her gaze had focused upon a hole in the paper.
Through the opening protruded a long strand of dark
hair.</p>
<p>Louise saw it at the same instant and uttered a
choked, horrified scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human hair&mdash;&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, Penny! Turn it
over to the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo; said Penny in a calmer voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>With trembling fingers she untied the string. The
paper fell away and several objects dropped at Penny&rsquo;s
feet. Stooping, she picked up a girl&rsquo;s long black wig.
In addition, there was a dark veil, a crushed felt hat,
and a cheap cloth jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disguise!&rdquo; exclaimed Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the girl who tossed this bundle into the river
was the same one we saw aboard the steamer! But why
did she wear these things and then try to get rid of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Penny, don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; Louise demanded
impressively. &ldquo;She was a crook just as I
thought. And she must have been the one who robbed
Tillie Fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>THE RIVER&rsquo;S VICTIM</i></h2>
<p>Penny stared at the curious array of objects
found in the discarded bundle. Unquestionably, they
had been worn by the mysterious young woman observed
aboard the <i>Goodtime</i>. However, she was not
certain she agreed with Louise that the girl or her
escort had robbed Tillie Fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of a professional pickpocket bothering
with a disguise,&rdquo; she said doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why else would the girl wear one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea,&rdquo; admitted Penny. &ldquo;Everything
about it is queer. For instance, what became of her
escort after the steamer docked? And who was that
other young man in the gray car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He appeared to be fairly well-to-do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did. For that matter, the girl was elegantly
dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise kicked at the bundle with her foot. &ldquo;What
shall we do with these things? Toss them away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, not!&rdquo; Penny carefully rewrapped the wig,
jacket, and other articles in the crumpled newspaper.
&ldquo;I shall take them home with me. One never knows
what may develop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Louise could inquire the meaning of her
chum&rsquo;s remark, a taxi drew up nearby. The door
swung open and out leaped a lean young man in a
well-tailored blue suit and snap-brim hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Jerry Livingston!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny,
recognizing one of her father&rsquo;s reporters.</p>
<p>The young man saw the girls and came toward
them. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he greeted cheerily. &ldquo;Swell night for a
murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not carrying concealed weapons,&rdquo;
laughed Penny. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delayed at the <i>Star</i> office. He sent me to meet the
boat in his place. The fog made traffic slow. That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking each of the girls by an elbow, he steered
them to the waiting taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Riverview Star</i>,&rdquo; he instructed the driver, and
slammed the car door.</p>
<p>The fog was not so dense after the cab left the
docks, but the entire river valley was blanketed, making
it necessary for automobiles to proceed with headlights
turned on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have a nice time?&rdquo; Jerry inquired as the cab crept
along the waterfront streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; answered Penny, &ldquo;but we ran into a
little adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust you for that,&rdquo; chuckled the reporter. &ldquo;City
Editor DeWitt was telling the boys at the office that
he&rsquo;d bet you would come home dragging a mystery
by its tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; Penny laughed, thrusting the newspaper
bundle into his hands. &ldquo;Lou and I did a little
fishing from the dock and this is what we hooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jerry examined the contents of the strange
package, the girls competed with each other in relating
their experiences aboard the steamer. Although
the reporter was deeply interested, he could offer no
theory to explain why the young woman had discarded
the bundle of clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise&rsquo;s guess seems as good as any,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;The girl may have been the one who robbed
Tillie Fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pickpockets usually frequent crowds,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;During the entire trip both the girl and her escort
kept strictly to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry retied the bundle, tossing it into her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mystery is too much for me,&rdquo; he said lightly.
&ldquo;Afraid you&rsquo;ll have to solve it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Penny lapsed into meditative silence, yet oddly her
thoughts centered upon nothing in particular. For a
reason she never tried to explain, the waterfront seldom
failed to cast its magical spell over her. She loved
the medley of sounds, deep-throated blasts of coal
boats mingling with the staccato toots of the tugboats,
the rumble and clank of bridges being raised and
lowered.</p>
<p>Always Penny had felt an intimate connection with
the river, for her home overlooked the Big Bear. Not
many miles away flowed the Kobalt, so closely associated
with Mud-Cat Joe and the Vanishing Houseboat.
It was the Kobalt which very nearly had claimed
Jerry&rsquo;s life, yet had brought the <i>Star</i> one of its greatest
news stories.</p>
<p>Ever since she was a little girl, Penny had loved
newspaper work. Her entire life seemed bound up
with printer&rsquo;s ink and all that it connoted. She had
learned to write well and Mrs. Weems, who had
served as the Parker housekeeper for many years, predicted
that one day the girl would become a celebrated
journalist.</p>
<p>The taxi came to a sudden halt and with a start
Penny emerged from her reverie. Jerry leaned forward
to ask the driver why they had stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the road very well,&rdquo; the man replied.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a bridge ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>As the car crept forward again, Penny peered from
the window. Through the swirling gray mist the indistinct
lights which marked the arching steel bridge
were faintly visible. A pillar gradually emerged, and
beside it the shadowy, slouching figure of a man. His
burning cigarette made a pin point of light as he tossed
it into the river.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny&rsquo;s blood ran cold, for a second man
appeared on the bridge. Stealthily he approached the
one who gazed with such absorption into the inky
waters. His purpose was shockingly clear to those who
watched.</p>
<p>Penny screamed a warning; the taxi driver halted
his cab, shouting huskily. Their cries came too late.</p>
<p>They saw the attacker leap upon his victim. There
was a brief, intense struggle, then a body went hurtling
from the bridge, fifty feet to the water below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that?&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;That man was
pushed off the bridge! He&rsquo;ll drown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to save him,&rdquo; said Jerry.</p>
<p>As the cab came to a standstill, Jerry, the driver,
and the two girls, sprang to the pavement. In the
murky darkness the bridge appeared deserted, but they
could hear the pounding footsteps of the attacker who
sought to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that guy to me!&rdquo; exclaimed the cab driver.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Abandoning his taxi, he darted across the bridge in
pursuit.</p>
<p>Jerry and the girls ran to the river bank. Below
they could see a man struggling in the water and hear
his choked cry for help.</p>
<p>Jerry kicked off his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; commanded Penny. &ldquo;You may not need to
jump in after him. That boat will be there in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She indicated a tugboat which had passed beneath
the bridge and was swerving toward the struggling
man. As the young people anxiously watched, they
saw it lay to while the captain fished the victim from
the water with a boat-hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for that,&rdquo; murmured Penny. &ldquo;I
hope the poor fellow is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope our driver catches the man who did
the pushing,&rdquo; declared Louise feelingly. &ldquo;I never witnessed
a more vicious attack in my entire life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the cabman recrossed the bridge,
scrambling down to the river bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow got away,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;He had a car
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see the license number?&rdquo; Jerry inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was watching the tugboat which had been
tied up only a short distance from the bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, let&rsquo;s go down there,&rdquo; she proposed. &ldquo;I want
to be certain that man is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter hesitated, then consented. Leaving
Louise with the cab driver, he and Penny descended
the steep, muddy slope.</p>
<p>The boat had been made fast to a piling. Face downward
on the long leather seat of the pilot-house, lay
the rescued man. Working over him was the captain,
a short, stocky man with grease-smeared hands and
clothing saturated with coal dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything we can do?&rdquo; called Jerry from shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know yet if he&rsquo;ll need a doctor,&rdquo; answered
the tugboat captain, barely glancing up. &ldquo;It was a
nasty fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry leaped on deck, leaving Penny behind, for
the space was too wide to be easily spanned.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin Captain Dubbins was expertly applying
artificial resuscitation, but he paused as the man
on the seat showed signs of reviving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struck the water flat on his back,&rdquo; he commented
briefly. &ldquo;Lucky I saw him fall or I never could have
fished him out. Not on a night like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow didn&rsquo;t fall,&rdquo; corrected Jerry. &ldquo;He was
pushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dubbins glanced up, meeting the reporter&rsquo;s
gaze steadily. He offered no comment for the man on
the seat groaned and rolled over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Take it easy. You&rsquo;ll
tumble off the seat if you don&rsquo;t stay quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My back,&rdquo; mumbled the man.</p>
<p>In the glare of the swinging electric light his face
was ghastly white and contorted with pain. Jerry
judged him to be perhaps thirty-two. He wore tight-fitting
blue trousers and a coarse flannel shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My back,&rdquo; he moaned again, pressing his hand to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took a hard wrench when you hit the water,&rdquo;
commented the captain. &ldquo;Here, let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unbuttoned the shirt, and rolling the man over,
started to strip it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; snarled the other with surprising spirit.
&ldquo;Leave me alone! Get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry stepped forward to assist the captain. Ignoring
the man&rsquo;s feeble struggles, they pulled off his shirt.</p>
<p>Immediately they understood why he had tried to
prevent its removal. Across his bruised, battered back
had been tattooed in blue and black, the repulsive figure
of an octopus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>THE OCTOPUS TATTOO</i></h2>
<p>Jerry bent closer to examine the strange tattoo.
Between the two foremost arms of the octopus was
sketched a single word: ALL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All,&rsquo;&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;What does that signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His question angered the man on the couch. Snatching
the shirt from Captain Dubbins, he made a feeble,
ineffectual effort to get his arms into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want out o&rsquo; here,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Quit starin&rsquo;,
you two, and give me a hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; advised the tugboat captain soothingly.
&ldquo;We was just tryin&rsquo; to see if your back was
badly hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; the man muttered. Relaxing, he leaned
weakly against the leather cushions. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swallowed a little water,&rdquo; remarked the captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little?&rdquo; growled the other. &ldquo;Half the river went
down my gullet.&rdquo; As an afterthought he added:
&ldquo;Thanks for pullin&rsquo; me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; responded the captain dryly.
&ldquo;Ex-sailor, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can usually tell &rsquo;em. Out of work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s curt answers made it clear that
he resented questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Munn,&rdquo; the man replied after a slight hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to catch the man who pushed you off
the bridge,&rdquo; contributed Jerry. &ldquo;He got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailor gazed steadily, almost defiantly at the
reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one pushed me off the bridge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fell?&rdquo; echoed Jerry. &ldquo;Why, I thought I saw
you and another man struggling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought wrong,&rdquo; the sailor interrupted. &ldquo;I
was leaning over, lookin&rsquo; into the water an&rsquo; I lost my
balance. That was how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, Mr. Munn,&rdquo; said Jerry with exaggerated
politeness. &ldquo;Oh, by the way, what&rsquo;s the significance
of that octopus thing on your back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, will you?&rdquo; the sailor muttered.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t a man got any right to privacy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better not bother him while he&rsquo;s feeling so low,&rdquo;
said the tugboat captain significantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him
into some dry clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, he&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; Jerry said carelessly. With another
curious glance directed at the sailor, he left the pilot-house,
leaping from the deck to shore. Penny stood
waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, what was the matter with that fellow?&rdquo; she
demanded in a whisper. &ldquo;What did he have on his
back? And why did he lie about being pushed off the
bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard us talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. You were fairly shouting at each
other for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Munn wasn&rsquo;t very grateful to the captain
for being saved. He took offense when we tried to
look at his back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard you say something about an
octopus. Was it a tattoo, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and as strange a one as I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The
picture of an octopus. Between its forearms was the
word: &lsquo;All.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to learn, but Mr. John Munn wasn&rsquo;t in a
talkative mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems rather mysterious, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Jerry took Penny&rsquo;s arm to
aid her in making the steep climb. &ldquo;Sailors have some
funny ideas regarding self-decoration. This Munn was
a peculiar fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was odd that he would lie about being pushed
off the bridge. Jerry, will you write it for the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story isn&rsquo;t worth more than a few lines, Penny.
We can&rsquo;t say that Munn was pushed off the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Munn would deny it, and then the <i>Star</i> would
appear ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I owned a paper, I certainly would use the
story,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Why, it has wonderful possibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear your father never would agree. You talk
him into printing the yarn and I&rsquo;ll be glad to write it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose we must forget about it,&rdquo; Penny
grumbled. &ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;d like nothing better than
to work on the story myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the pavement, they cleaned mud from
their shoes before walking on to the waiting taxi.
Louise immediately plied them with questions, displaying
particular interest in the octopus tattoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose the man knew who pushed him
off the bridge?&rdquo; she inquired thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture he did,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;Probably that
was the reason he wouldn&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>The taxi crossed the bridge and made slow progress
away from the river. As the road gradually wound
toward higher ground, the fog became lighter and the
driver was able to make faster time. A clock chimed
the hour of eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about stopping somewhere for a bite to eat?&rdquo;
Jerry suddenly proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Dad be waiting at the <i>Star</i> office?&rdquo; Penny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He suggested that I keep you girls entertained
until around eleven-thirty if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being the case, we&rsquo;ll accept your invitation
with alacrity,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;How about the
Golden Pheasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t! Phillip&rsquo;s Bean Pot is nearer my
speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A block farther down the street Jerry paid the
driver and escorted the girls into a clean but low-priced
restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No item on the menu over ten cents,&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;Do your worst. I can take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise ordered sandwiches, while the
reporter fortified himself with a plate of scrambled
eggs, two doughnuts, and a cup of coffee. Returning
to the front counter for a forgotten napkin, he nodded
carelessly at an elderly man who sat alone, sipping a
glass of orange juice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The man acknowledged the greeting in an embarrassed
way, quickly lowering his head. Within a few
minutes he left the caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, who was he?&rdquo; Penny inquired curiously.
&ldquo;I am sure I&rsquo;ve seen him before, yet I can&rsquo;t remember
where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was old man Judson. Matthew Judson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the former publisher of the <i>Morning Press</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the old man&rsquo;s been going to pieces fast since
he closed his newspaper plant. Looks seedy, doesn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His clothes were a bit shiny. I thought he seemed
rather embarrassed because you spoke to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Judson feels his come-down I guess. In the
flush days he wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead in a beanery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he really poor, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably down to his last hundred thousand,&rdquo; the
reporter grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say is conflicting,&rdquo; declared Penny impatiently.
&ldquo;First you imply that Mr. Judson is poor,
and then that he&rsquo;s rich. I wish you would make up
your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know. Judson owns a fine home
on Drexell Boulevard which he&rsquo;s allowed to run down.
I&rsquo;ve been told he sold the <i>Morning Press</i> building several
months ago. Some say he has plenty of cash salted
away, others that he&rsquo;s broke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did he lose so much of his money, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one seems to know for certain. According to
rumor he plays the stock market heavily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange he closed down the <i>Morning Press</i>,&rdquo;
Penny remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;I always thought it
was a profitable paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did everyone else. The <i>Press</i> had a large circulation.
But one bright Monday morning Judson posted
a notice, closed the plant, and threw over a thousand
employes out of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was nearly a year ago, wasn&rsquo;t it, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen months to be exact. Why this sudden interest
in Judson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Penny replied vaguely. &ldquo;His
case seems rather pathetic. Then, too, he reminds me
of someone I&rsquo;ve seen recently. I wish I could recall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced at the wall clock, swallowing his
coffee with a gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to move along,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t
keep your father waiting, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the caf&eacute; and Jerry hailed a passing taxicab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only four blocks to the <i>Star</i> building,&rdquo; protested
Penny. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being too lavish with your
money, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll add this item to my expense account,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Jump in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The taxi turned left at Adams street, rolling slowly
through the downtown business section. Jerry peered
from the car window at a large, four-story stone building
which occupied a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place sure looks like a morgue these days,&rdquo;
he commented. &ldquo;<i>The Morning Press.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise likewise twisted sideways to stare
at the dark, deserted building. Windows were plastered
with disfiguring posters and the white stone blocks,
once so beautiful, were streaked with city grime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the <i>Press</i> closed, machinery, furniture and
everything else was left exactly as it stood,&rdquo; remarked
Jerry. &ldquo;Too bad an enterprising newspaper man
doesn&rsquo;t take over the place before it&rsquo;s a complete loss.
The present owner doesn&rsquo;t even employ a watchman
to protect the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem a shame&mdash;&rdquo; Penny began, only to
break off. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; inquired Jerry.</p>
<p>Penny had turned to glance back at the <i>Morning
Press</i> plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building isn&rsquo;t deserted!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light in one of the upstairs rooms!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>A PROSPECTIVE TENANT</i></h2>
<p>Jerry rolled down the window beside him and,
thrusting his head through it, glanced back at the
<i>Morning Press</i> building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you see a light?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on the third floor,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see it myself now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry grinned as he settled back into his place between
the two girls. &ldquo;You certainly get a kick out of
playing jokes,&rdquo; he accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t a joke, Jerry. Honestly, I saw a light.
Didn&rsquo;t you, Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m afraid your imagination
works overtime, Pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I saw,&rdquo; insisted Penny.</p>
<p>As Jerry and Louise smiled, she lapsed into injured
silence. However, she was certain she had not been
mistaken. Distinctly she had observed a light on the
third floor, a moving light which had been extinguished
before her companions had noticed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>The car presently drew up at the curb in front of
the <i>Star</i> building. Anthony Parker, a newspaper
tucked beneath his arm, stepped from the vestibule
where he had been waiting. He was a tall, slender man,
alert and courageous in following his convictions.
Under his management the <i>Riverview Star</i> had grown
to be one of the most influential papers in the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope we haven&rsquo;t kept you waiting, Mr. Parker,&rdquo;
Jerry greeted him, swinging open the cab door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a minute or two. Thanks, Jerry, for bringing
the girls from the boat. May we offer you a ride
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, Chief. I&rsquo;ll walk from here. Good
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry tipped his hat politely to Penny and Louise
as the cab drove away. Mr. Parker asked the girls if
they had enjoyed their trip aboard the <i>Goodtime</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat wasn&rsquo;t very well named, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
answered Penny. &ldquo;The trip proved to be rather terrible
but we met some interesting people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the drive to the Sidell home, she and Louise
talked as fast as they could, telling Mr. Parker about
Tillie Fellows, the mysterious young woman who
had dropped a bundle of clothing into the water, and
particularly the man with the strange octopus tattoo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell the rest of it, Penny,&rdquo; laughed
Louise as she bade her chum good-bye. &ldquo;Thanks for
bringing me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab rolled on, and Penny glanced questioningly
at her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the tattoo story?&rdquo; she asked
hopefully. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it make a dandy feature for the
<i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to say it sounds like first-grade fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad! Louise and Jerry will confirm everything
I&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt your word, Penny. I am sure
everything occurred as you report. Nevertheless, were
we to use the story our readers might question its
veracity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crush me with such big words, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veracity means truth, Penny. Now your story is
very interesting, but I think you may have placed your
own interpretation upon certain facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, according to John Munn&rsquo;s statement, he fell
from the bridge and was not pushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw it with my own two eyes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night is foggy. You easily could have been
mistaken. As for the octopus tattoo, what is so strange
about it? Sailors compete in striving for startling decorative
effects.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you could rationalize the national debt,&rdquo; accused
Penny. &ldquo;Very well, since you scorn my story
I&rsquo;ll give it to the High School paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea. That is, if your editor favors
highly colored journalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny made a grimace, knowing that her father
was deliberately teasing her. It was a constant source
of irritation that a boy named Fred Clousky had been
elected editor of the Riverview High School Chatter
instead of Penny by the margin of one vote. She disapproved
of Fred, his pimples, and particularly the
way he blue-penciled the occasional stories which she
submitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Riverview High Chatter is just as silly as its
name,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;If I had that sheet I&rsquo;d make it
into a real paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sour grapes?&rdquo; inquired her father softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; grinned Penny. &ldquo;But Fred is such an egg,
even more conservative than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab drew up before the Parker home. A light
still burned in the living room where Mrs. Weems,
the housekeeper, sat reading a magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have come, Penny,&rdquo; she remarked,
switching on another light. &ldquo;I was beginning to
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Since the death of Mrs. Parker many years before
Mrs. Weems had taken complete charge of the household,
caring for Penny and loving her as her own
daughter. There were occasions when she found the
impulsive girl difficult to restrain, but certainly never
dull or uninteresting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems soon went to bed, leaving Penny and
her father to explore the refrigerator. As they helped
themselves to cold ham, potato salad, and celery, Penny
spoke of the light which she had seen in the abandoned
<i>Morning Press</i> building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been a watchman making his usual
rounds,&rdquo; commented her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry tells me the building has no watchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been a reflection from a car headlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t lose sleep over it,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Parker lightly. &ldquo;Better run along to bed now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny arose at six-thirty the next morning, and before
breakfast had written a two-page story about
John Munn for the Riverview High School Chatter.
She read it twice and was very well pleased with her
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Editor Fred is lucky to get this,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He
should make it the lead story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Off to school at a quarter to nine, Penny deposited
her literary treasure in a box provided for journalistic
contributions. All that day she went from class to
class, warmed by the knowledge that she had accomplished
an excellent piece of writing. To Louise
she confided that she thought the work might improve
her grade in English Composition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve decided to contribute to the paper
again,&rdquo; declared her chum. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you and Fred
buried the hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t bear him any grudge,&rdquo; returned Penny.
&ldquo;Of course, everyone knows he campaigned for the
editorship with free candy and soda pop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At three-thirty, a minute before the closing bell
rang, Fred Clousky sauntered down the aisle. With
a flourish he dropped two pages of copy on Penny&rsquo;s
desk, face upward. Across one of the pages in huge
blue letters had been written: &ldquo;Too imaginative for
<i>Chatter</i>. Language too flowery. Spelling bad. Try us
again sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A red stain crept over Penny&rsquo;s cheeks. Her blue
eyes began to snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poisonous little mushroom!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;If
he thinks he can do this to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closing bell rang, and immediately a group of
sympathetic friends gathered about Penny. They all
tried to soothe her feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it bother you,&rdquo; Louise advised her chum.
&ldquo;Of course, he did it just to make you peeved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spelling bad,&rsquo;&rdquo; Penny read aloud. &ldquo;Look at this
word he underlined! Anyone could tell I merely
struck a wrong letter on my typewriter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crumpling the page, she tossed it into the waste
paper basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Too imaginative,&rsquo;&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;&lsquo;Language
too flowery&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it, Penny,&rdquo; laughed Louise, leading her
toward the locker room. &ldquo;Fred always has been jealous
of you because you&rsquo;ve had stories published in the <i>Star</i>.
Don&rsquo;t let him know that you&rsquo;re annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am acting silly,&rdquo; admitted Penny, relaxing.
&ldquo;What I must do is to give this problem a good,
hard think. Editor Fred will hear from me yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Declining an invitation to play tennis, she went directly
home. For an hour she lay on the davenport,
staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, are you ill?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Weems anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m in conference with myself,&rdquo; answered
Penny. &ldquo;I am trying to arrive at a momentous decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, she began to scribble figures on a sheet
of paper. When her father came home at five o&rsquo;clock
he found her engaged in that occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Penny,&rdquo; he remarked, hanging up his hat,
&ldquo;how did it go today? The editor of <i>Chatter</i> accepted
your contribution I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Penny grinned ruefully. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, let&rsquo;s
discuss a less painful subject,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Suppose
you tell me what you know about Matthew Judson
and the <i>Morning Press</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this sudden display of interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw Mr. Judson last night at the Bean Pot.
He looked rather depressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker sat down on the arm of the davenport.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad about Judson,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I always
admired him because he was a clever newspaper man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever? Didn&rsquo;t he mis-manage the paper so that
it had to close?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that anyone ever learned. No, I never could
figure out why Judson quit. The <i>Press</i> had a large
circulation and plenty of advertisers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean who owns it,&rdquo; Penny explained. &ldquo;Not
Mr. Judson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building was taken over a few months ago by
a man named George Veeley. Come to think of it, I
once brought him home with me. You should remember
him, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. He was rather nice. I wonder what he plans
to do with the <i>Press</i> building and its equipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it for speculation, I assume. In my opinion
he&rsquo;ll have it empty for a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I rather doubt it,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;He has a prospective
tenant now, only he doesn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Mr. Parker smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it all planned,&rdquo; announced Penny with quiet
finality. &ldquo;What this town needs is a good, live newspaper,
and an imaginative editor to run it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo; With difficulty Mr. Parker kept his
face composed. &ldquo;And where do you propose to start
your newspaper? In the old <i>Press</i> building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took the words out of my mouth, Dad. Everything
is there, awaiting the touch of my magic wand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little matter of rent. Several thousand a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a solution for that problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your staff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gather it as I prosper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The necessary capital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mere detail,&rdquo; said Penny grandly. &ldquo;I meet only
one obstacle at a time. Tomorrow I shall accost Mr.
Veeley with an attractive proposition. If he falls into
my net, Riverview&rsquo;s newest paper, <i>The Weekly
Times</i>, makes its bow to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>COBWEBS AND RUST</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, do I understand you correctly?
You are asking for the use of the <i>Morning
Press</i> building without the payment of rent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Veeley, slightly bald and with a bulging waistline,
regarded Penny across the polished mahogany
desk. Upon arriving at his office that Saturday morning,
he had found the girl awaiting him. For the past
ten minutes she had stunned him with her remarkable
figures and plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged.
&ldquo;What Riverview needs is a newspaper unhampered
by the conservatism of over-aged minds.
Now you have a fine building and equipment which
is standing idle, fast falling into decay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decay?&rdquo; Mr. Veeley inquired mildly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Expensive machinery soon rusts and becomes
practically worthless unless kept in use,&rdquo; declared
Penny with authority. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll agree to my proposition,
I&rsquo;ll publish a weekly paper there, see that your
property is kept in good condition, and turn the plant
back to you whenever you can find a prosperous
renter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father sent you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, no! Dad thinks it&rsquo;s all a great joke.
But it isn&rsquo;t! I <i>know</i> I can make a success of the paper
if only I have a chance to test my ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Veeley could not fail to be impressed by
Penny&rsquo;s earnest, appealing manner. The novelty of
her plan both amused and intrigued him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help you start your paper,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;However, I doubt if you comprehend the cost of
such a venture. Even should I permit the use of my
building rent free, how would you meet such expenses
as light, water and heat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have a plan for everything,&rdquo; insisted Penny
grandly. &ldquo;All I need is a building. I&rsquo;ll have the windows
washed for you and do a good job of house
cleaning. With me in charge you&rsquo;ll be able to dismiss
your watchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No watchman?&rdquo; Penny inquired innocently. &ldquo;Last
night when I drove past the building I saw a light on
the third floor. Evidently someone is prowling about
there, Mr. Veeley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain you saw a light?&rdquo; the man inquired,
disturbed by the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. Excuse me for advising you, Mr.
Veeley, but you really should have someone to guard
your property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Veeley smiled broadly. &ldquo;You are a very convincing
young lady. While I realize it is a foolish thing
to do, I am tempted to let you have the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Veeley, that&rsquo;s wonderful! You&rsquo;ll never
regret it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll allow you the use of the building for a month,&rdquo;
resumed Mr. Veeley. &ldquo;At the end of that time we&rsquo;ll
discuss the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was thrown into such a frenzy of excitement
that she scarcely could remain outwardly serene until
she had left the office. Once on the street she ran
the entire distance to the <i>Star</i> building, dashing into
her father&rsquo;s suite with all the sound effects of a laboring
steam engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; she cried dramatically. &ldquo;I have it! The key
to the <i>Morning Press</i> plant! Now I&rsquo;m on my way to
draw my savings from the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell
me Mr. Veeley listened to your crazy scheme!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heartily in favor of it, Dad. Now I must rush
off to the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here,&rdquo; her father commanded as she
started for the door. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow you to withdraw
your savings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I launch the <i>Weekly Times</i> without
capital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really determined to try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker reached for a cheque book. &ldquo;How much
will you need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just sign your name at the bottom and leave
the amount blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I prefer not to financially cripple myself
for life. One hundred dollars is my limit. I&rsquo;m throwing
it down a sink-hole, but the lessons you&rsquo;ll learn
may be worth the cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do a lot with a hundred dollars,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;Thanks, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up the cheque before the ink was dry
and, dropping a kiss lightly on her father&rsquo;s cheek, was
gone.</p>
<p>From the corner drugstore Penny telephoned
Louise, telling her the news and asking her to come
downtown at once. Fifteen minutes later her chum
met her at the entrance to the <i>Morning Press</i> building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think, Lou!&rdquo; she murmured, unlocking the
front door. &ldquo;This huge plant all mine! I&rsquo;m a publisher
at last!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re completely insane if you ask me,&rdquo; retorted
Louise. &ldquo;This place is a dreadful mess. You&rsquo;ll never be
able to clean it up, let alone get out an issue of the
paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had passed through the vestibule to the
lower floor room which once had served as the <i>Press</i>&rsquo;
circulation department. Behind the high service
counter, desks and chairs remained untouched, covered
by a thick layer of dust. Cobwebs hung from the
ceiling light fixtures and festooned the walls.</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, the girls glanced briefly into the
newsroom, and then wandered on to the composing
room. Penny&rsquo;s gaze roved over long rows of linotype
machines and steel trucks which were used to hold
page forms. There were bins of type, Cheltenham,
Goudy, Century&mdash;more varieties than she had ever
seen before.</p>
<p>Passing the stereotyping department, the girls entered
the press room where slumbered ten giant
double-decked rotary presses. Lying on the roller of
one was a torn strip of newspaper, the last issue of the
<i>Morning Press</i> ever printed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives one a queer feeling to see all this,&rdquo; said
Louise. &ldquo;Why do you suppose Judson closed the plant
when it was prosperous?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one seems to know the answer,&rdquo; Penny replied,
stooping to peer into an empty ink pot. &ldquo;But it
doesn&rsquo;t seem possible a man would give up his business,
throw so many persons out of work, without a good
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His bad luck seems to be yours,&rdquo; Louise remarked
gloomily. &ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;ve fallen heir to all this,
what will you do with it? It will take a sizeable chunk
of your hundred dollars just to get the place cleaned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not according to my calculations,&rdquo; chuckled
Penny. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s choose our offices and then we&rsquo;ll discuss
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our offices?&rdquo; echoed Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in on this
brain-storm of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are. You&rsquo;ll be the editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the managing editor,&rdquo; said Penny gently.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your office, and oodles of authority. Of
course, you&rsquo;ll have to work hard keeping our staff in
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What staff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll recruit from Riverview High, concentrating
on the journalism majors. Now I think Jack Malone
will be our new advertising manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Malone! Why, Penny, he hasn&rsquo;t an ounce of
push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Lou. But his father is president of the
Malone Glass Company. I figure if his son is in charge
of advertising&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I get the idea,&rdquo; interrupted Louise. &ldquo;Penny, with a
head like yours, we should land all the important accounts
in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aim to win several fat ones away from the <i>Star</i>,&rdquo;
Penny said with quiet confidence. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, it will
be bankruptcy before the first issue of the paper is off
the press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise glanced dubiously at the dusty machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no denying you&rsquo;re a genius, Penny. Even
so, I don&rsquo;t see how you expect to get these presses
running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll only need one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but you can&rsquo;t recruit pressmen or linotype
operators from Riverview High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;The first issue
of the <i>Times</i> will be printed at the <i>Star</i> plant. Dad
doesn&rsquo;t know it yet. After that&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll think of
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you propose to get this place cleaned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every person who works on our paper must wield
a broom, Lou. After we&rsquo;ve chosen our offices, we&rsquo;ll
scamper forth and gather our staff together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the second floor, the girls inspected
the offices adjoining the newsroom. Penny selected
for hers the one which previously had been occupied
by Matthew Judson. His name remained on the
frosted-glass door, and the walls bore etchings and
paintings of considerable value.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>In the top drawer of the flat-top desk there remained
an assortment of pens, erasers, thumbtacks,
and small articles. All letters and papers had been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Judson apparently left here in a great hurry,&rdquo;
she remarked. &ldquo;For some reason he never returned for
the paintings and personal trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise chose an office adjoining Penny&rsquo;s new quarters.
They both were admiring the view from the
window when her chum suddenly drew herself into
an attitude of attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; inquired Louise, mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard someone moving about,&rdquo; whispered
Penny. &ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remained motionless; listening. A board
creaked.</p>
<p>Darting to the door, Penny flung it open. The newsroom
was deserted, but she was almost certain she
heard footsteps retreating swiftly down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, we&rsquo;re not alone in this building!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard someone, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls ran through the newsroom to the hall,
and down the stairway. Three steps from the bottom,
Penny suddenly halted. On the service counter of the
advertising department lay a man&rsquo;s grimy felt hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Someone <i>was</i> upstairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may still be here, too. Penny, did you leave the
entrance door unlocked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A loiterer may have wandered into the building,
and then left when we gave chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without his hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It probably was forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I intend to look carefully about,&rdquo; declared
Penny. &ldquo;After all, I am responsible for this place
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls were uneasy as they wandered from
room to room. Penny even ventured into the basement
where a number of rats had taken refuge. The building
seemed deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only wasting precious time,&rdquo; she said at
last. &ldquo;Whoever the intruder was, he&rsquo;s gone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retracing their way to the advertising department,
the girls stopped short, staring at the counter. The
hat, observed there only a few minutes before, had
vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>HEADLINES AND HEADACHES</i></h2>
<p>Penny and Louise stared at the counter, unable
to believe their eyesight. They knew that they had
not touched the hat. Obviously it had been removed
by the man who had left it there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hat&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; whispered Louise nervously.
&ldquo;That means someone is still inside the building!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could have slipped out the front door while we
were in the basement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the girls made a complete tour of the
building, entering every room. Unable to find an intruder
they finally decided to give up the futile search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this I&rsquo;ll take care to lock the door,&rdquo; declared
Penny as they prepared to leave the building. &ldquo;Now
let&rsquo;s get busy and gather our staff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>During the next hour she and Louise motored from
house to house, recruiting school friends. Early afternoon
found the old <i>Press</i> building invaded by a crew
of willing and enthusiastic young workers. A group
of fifteen boys and girls, armed with mops, window
cloths and brooms, fell to work with such vigor that
by nightfall the main portion of the building had
emerged from its cocoon of grime.</p>
<p>Weary but well satisfied with her first day as a newspaper
publisher, Penny went home and to bed. At
breakfast the next morning she ate with such a preoccupied
air that her father commented upon her
sober countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t encountered knotty problems
so soon in your journalistic venture,&rdquo; he remarked
teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None which you can&rsquo;t solve for me,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to run the octopus tattoo story on the
front page of our first issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? And when does the first issue appear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll print one week from today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Sunday paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought probably your presses wouldn&rsquo;t be busy
on that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> presses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I haven&rsquo;t hired my pressroom force yet. I
plan to make up the paper, set the type and lock it in
the page forms. Then I&rsquo;ll haul it over to your plant
for stereotyping and the press run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I object?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, will you, Dad? I&rsquo;m such a pathetic
little competitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run off the first edition for you,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
promised. &ldquo;But mind, only the first. How many
papers will you want? About five hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, roughly, six thousand. That should take care
of my street sales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker&rsquo;s fork clattered against his plate. &ldquo;Your
street sales?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Where, may I ask, did you
acquire your distribution organization?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have plans,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;Running a
paper is really very simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady, you&rsquo;re riding for a heartbreaking
fall,&rdquo; warned her father severely. &ldquo;Six thousand copies!
Why, you&rsquo;ll be lucky to dispose of three hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; said Penny confidently.</p>
<p>During the week which followed there were no
idle moments for the staff of the newly organized
<i>Weekly Times</i>. Leaving Louise in charge of the news
output, Penny concentrated most of her attention on
the problem of winning advertisers. Starting with a
page taken by the Malone Glass Company, she and
Jack Malone toured the city, selling a total of forty-two
full columns.</p>
<p>The novelty of the enterprise intrigued many business
men, while others took space because they were
friends of Mr. Malone or Mr. Parker. Money continued
to pour into the till of the <i>Weekly Times</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Yet, when everything should have been sailing along
smoothly, Louise complained that it was becoming
difficult to keep her staff of writers satisfied. One by
one they were falling away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must expect that,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Always
the weak drop by the wayside. If only we can get on
a paying basis, we&rsquo;ll be able to offer small salaries. Then
we&rsquo;ll have more workers than we can use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly look to the future,&rdquo; laughed Louise.
&ldquo;Personally I have grave doubts we&rsquo;ll ever get the
first issue set up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every moment which could be spared from school,
Penny spent at the plant. Long after the other young
people had left, she remained, trying to master the
intricacies of the linotype machine. Although in theory
it operated somewhat like a typewriter, she could not
learn to set type accurately.</p>
<p>Friday night, alone in the building, the task suddenly
overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machines, machines, machines,&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;The paper is going to be a mess and all because I
can&rsquo;t run this hateful old thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping her head wearily on the keyboard, Penny
wept with vexation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Suddenly she stiffened. Unmistakably, footsteps
were coming softly down the hall toward the composing
room.</p>
<p>Twice during the week Louise had declared that
she believed someone prowled about the plant when
it was deserted. Penny had been too busy to worry
about the matter. But now, realizing that she was alone
and without protection, her pulse began to hammer.</p>
<p>A shadow fell across the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who is there?&rdquo; Penny called, her voice unsteady.</p>
<p>To her relief, a young man, his bashful grin reassuringly
familiar, stepped into the cavernous room.
Bill Carlyle was one of her father&rsquo;s best linotype
operators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You nearly startled me out of my wits,&rdquo; she
laughed shakily, &ldquo;What brought you here, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed the light burning,&rdquo; the operator replied,
twisting his hat in his hands. &ldquo;I thought I would drop
in and see how you were getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s nice of you, Bill.&rdquo; Penny saw that he
was gazing hard at her. She was afraid he could tell
that she had been crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys say you&rsquo;re doing right well.&rdquo; Bill moved
nearer the linotype machine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at my work,&rdquo; pleaded Penny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
simply awful. I can&rsquo;t get the hang of this horrid old
machine. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t started a newspaper&mdash;I must
have been crazy just as everyone says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; said Bill
soothingly. &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s nothing to running a linotype.
Give me a piece of copy and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slid into the vacant chair and his fingers began to
move over the keyboard. As if by magic, type fell
into place, and there were no mistakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it marvelously,&rdquo; said Penny admiringly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten years practice. Shoot out your copy
now and I&rsquo;ll set some of it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, you&rsquo;re a darling! But dare you do it? What
about the union?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just between you and me,&rdquo; he grinned.
&ldquo;You need a helping hand and I&rsquo;m here to give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until midnight Bill remained at his post, setting
more type in three hours than Penny had done in
three days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your front page should look pretty good at any
rate,&rdquo; he said as they left the building together. &ldquo;Using
rather old stories though, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one about the man who was pushed off the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story is still news,&rdquo; Penny said defensively.
&ldquo;No other paper has used it. Didn&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it was good,&rdquo; he responded.</p>
<p>Now that several days had elapsed since her experience
at the river, even Penny&rsquo;s interest in John
Munn and his strange tattoo, had faded. However,
she was determined that the story should appear in
the paper if for no other reason than to plague the
editor of <i>Chatter</i>.</p>
<p>According to a report from Louise, Fred Clousky
had called at the <i>Times</i> early that afternoon, and had
seemed very gloomy as he inspected the plant. He
had spent nearly a half hour in the composing room, a
fact which Penny later was to recall with chagrin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Fred,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;After my paper comes
out his <i>Chatter</i> will look more than ever like a sick
cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saturday was another day of toil, but by six o&rsquo;clock,
aided by the few faithful members of her staff, the
last stick of type was set, the pages locked and transported
to the <i>Star</i> ready for the Sunday morning run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here early tomorrow,&rdquo; Penny told the pressman.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start the edition rolling until I arrive. I
want to press the button myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At her urging, Mr. Parker, Jerry Livingston, Salt
Sommers, and many members of the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> staff, came
to view the stereotyped plates waiting to be fitted on
the press rollers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well, Penny,&rdquo; praised her father. &ldquo;I
confess I never thought you would get this far. Still
figuring on a street sale of six thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve increased the number to seven,&rdquo; laughed
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you plan to get the papers sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my secret, Dad. You may be surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exhausted but happy, Penny went home and to
bed. She was up at six, and after a hastily eaten breakfast,
arrived at the <i>Star</i> office in time to greet the workmen
who were just coming on duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is set,&rdquo; the foreman told her presently.
&ldquo;You can start the press now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was so nervous that her hand trembled as
she pressed the electric switch. There was a low, whining
noise as the wheels began to turn, slowly at first,
then faster and faster. Pressmen moved back and forth,
oiling the machinery and tightening screws.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze was upon the long stream of paper
feeding into the press. In a moment the neatly folded
newspapers would slide out at the rate of eight hundred
a minute. Only slightly over an hour and the
run would be completed.</p>
<p>The first printed paper dropped from the press, and
the foreman reached for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; he said, offering it to Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Almost reverently she accepted the paper. Even
though there were only eight pages, each one represented
hours of labor. She had turned out a professional
job, and could rightly feel proud.</p>
<p><a href="#front">And then suddenly Penny&rsquo;s eyes fell upon the uppermost
line of the front page.</a> She gasped and leaned
against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ruined!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Ruined! Someone has
played a cruel joke on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; inquired the press foreman,
reaching for another paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; wailed Penny. &ldquo;Just look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the name of the paper, printed in
large black letters. It read: THE WEAKLY TIMES.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the laughing stock of Riverview,&rdquo; Penny
moaned. &ldquo;The papers can&rsquo;t go out that way. Stop the
press!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>PETER FENESTRA</i></h2>
<p>As the foreman turned off the rotarypress, the
loud throb of machinery died away and the flowing
web of paper became motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could the mistake have been made?&rdquo; Penny
murmured disconsolately. &ldquo;I know that originally the
name-plate was set up right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have taken page proofs and checked
the mat,&rdquo; said the foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did! At least I took page proofs. I&rsquo;ll admit I
was careless about the mats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks as if someone played a joke on you,&rdquo;
replied the foreman.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face hardened. &ldquo;I can guess who did it!
Fred Clousky! Louise told me he spent a long while
in the composing room one afternoon while I was
away. He must have changed the type just to make me
look ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s done anyway,&rdquo; said the foreman with a
shrug. &ldquo;What will you do about the run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never let it go through this way. I&rsquo;d rather die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman reminded Penny that with paid advertisements
she would be compelled to print an issue.
She knew that it would not be possible to make a
change in the starter plate. The entire page must be
recast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose the type can be matched in this
plant,&rdquo; she said gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have some like it,&rdquo; replied the foreman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon he returned to report that type was available
and that the work could be done by the stereotypers.
However, the men would expect overtime pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them anything they want,&rdquo; said Penny
recklessly. &ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a trying wait the new plate was made ready
and locked on the cylinder. Once more the great press
thundered. Again papers began to pour from the machine,
every fiftieth one slightly out of line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want done with &rsquo;em?&rdquo; inquired the
foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the papers carried to the mailing room and
stacked by the door,&rdquo; she instructed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around
in the morning to arrange for deliveries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s first issue of the <i>Star</i> was hot off the press
when Penny stationed herself beside the veritable
mountain of papers. The room was a bedlam, with
newsboys shouting noisily for their wares. As they
passed her on their way to the street, she waylaid them
one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, boys,&rdquo; she said with an expansive
smile. &ldquo;Two dozen papers each. Sell them for a nickel
and keep half of it for yourself. Turn in the money at
the <i>Weekly Times</i> office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two and a half cents!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the boys.
&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s more than we get for selling the <i>Star</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generosity is my motto,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;Just
push those papers for all you&rsquo;re worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the <i>Star</i> plant, she went directly to the
<i>Weekly Times</i> building. Permission had been granted
to absent herself from school, and she planned to be
busy throughout the day, checking on paper sales.</p>
<p>As Penny unlocked the front door, she noticed that
a faint odor of tobacco lingered in the air. A perplexed
frown knitted her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;None of the boys are
allowed to smoke here. I wonder if someone disobeyed
rules, or if there&rsquo;s really a prowler in the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too busy to search the plant again, Penny gave the
matter scant consideration. Tossing a package of lunch
on the counter, she prepared for a hard day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Now and then, to rest her mind from columns of
figures, she wandered to the window. Down the street,
newsboys called their wares and it pleased her that
they shouted the <i>Weekly Times</i> as frequently as they
did the <i>Star</i>.</p>
<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock the boys began to straggle in with
their money. Only a few had failed to sell all of their
papers, and not one neglected to make a report. Penny&rsquo;s
final check-up disclosed that six thousand eight hundred
and twenty-nine Weeklies had been sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t expect to do that well after the novelty
wears off,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But one thing is assured. My
<i>Weekly</i> isn&rsquo;t going to be <i>weakly</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a large sum of money in her possession, Penny
decided to take no chance of losing it. After making a
careful count, she poured the coins into a bag which
she transported by car to the bank.</p>
<p>It was lunch-time when she returned to the plant.
She went to the counter for the package of sandwiches.
To her surprise it had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who took my food?&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>Penny was annoyed. She did not believe that one of
the newsboys had picked up the package. Accumulative
evidence pointed to a likelihood that someone was
hiding in the building. The moving light, tobacco
smoke, unexplained footsteps, suggested that a tramp
might be using the empty plant as a comfortable
shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how can he get in?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Doors
and windows are kept locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny considered whether or not to report the
matter to police, the front door opened. A man of early
middle age, well dressed, but with a sharp, weather-beaten
face and a mis-shapen nose, entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This the office of the <i>Weekly Times</i>?&rdquo; he demanded
grumpily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Is there anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see the editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! A girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled and waited. The stranger hesitated and
then took the <i>Weekly Times</i> from his overcoat pocket.
With his forefinger he jabbed at a story on the front
page&mdash;Penny&rsquo;s account of the tattooed man who had
been pushed from the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who wrote this?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Penny&rsquo;s words surprised the man although he
tried not to disclose it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a right interesting yarn,&rdquo; he said after a
long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it.&rdquo; Penny stared at the man with
interest, wondering why he had come and what he
wanted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was kind of curious to know where you got your
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I saw it happen, Mr&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe you
told me your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra. Peter Fenestra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was driving near the bridge at the time the man
was pushed into the water,&rdquo; Penny resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see the one who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not clearly. May I ask why you are so interested
in the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe I knew that man, Munn. What
became of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. He was rescued by a tugboat
captain. Everything I know about the affair is in the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you kindly,&rdquo; Mr. Fenestra said, tipping
his hat.</p>
<p>Penny watched him leave the office and walk to his
car. She had never seen the man before to her knowledge.
Although she should have felt flattered by his
visit, it left her with a vague, unexplainable sensation
of distrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer about the way he came
here,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;Perhaps he knows more than he
pretended.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Penny soon dismissed the matter from her mind,
turning her thoughts to the problem of the missing
lunch. Resolutely she made a tour of the building,
venturing everywhere save into the basement. As she
had half expected, she found no one. However, returning
once more to her work, she occasionally
caught herself listening for footsteps.</p>
<p>At three-thirty Louise came from school with other
members of the <i>Times</i> staff. She and Penny retired to
the latter&rsquo;s private office there to discuss plans for the
next week&rsquo;s paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou,&rdquo; said Penny abruptly, &ldquo;did you ever hear of a
man named Peter Fenestra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here today to ask me about the octopus
tattoo story. What can you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much, Penny. He lives on a farm two
miles from the south edge of Riverview. A place called
The Willows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is he a farmer?&rdquo; Penny was surprised. &ldquo;I never
would have guessed that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t one. He merely lives there. According to
the report, he has prospered by leaps and bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he make his money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one seems to know. When Fenestra came here
a year or so ago he didn&rsquo;t appear to have anything.
Lately he bought a fine car, and he spends money
rather lavishly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He inquired about John Munn,&rdquo; Penny remarked.
&ldquo;Somehow I had a feeling that he was trying to pump
information from me for a particular reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who know Fenestra say he&rsquo;s a sly old fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way he impressed me, Lou. Perhaps I
flatter myself, but I believe my tattoo story may cause
quite a stir in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Fenestra annoyed by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Lou, although he tried to cover his feelings.
He may or may not be a friend of John Munn,
but he certainly was anxious to learn what became of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask him any questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, his visit took me by surprise. But I&rsquo;ve been
thinking, Lou. I very much want a follow up story on
John Munn for next week&rsquo;s paper. Suppose we run
out to Fenestra&rsquo;s farm tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What purpose would there be in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra may be able to tell us interesting facts
which will throw light on the mystery. He may understand
the significance of the octopus tattoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather hopeful, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; promised Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a curiosity
to see The Willows. Besides, I need a vacation from my
strenuous duties as editor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>THE STORM CAVE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Penny,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Parker casually at
the breakfast table. &ldquo;I finally bought the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny closed her history book with a loud snap,
favoring her father with complete attention. &ldquo;You
bought a cottage?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Where? When?
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked about it for the past week, but you were
so busy stealing the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> advertisers that you never
listened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ears now, Dad,&rdquo; Penny assured him, absently
reaching for a piece of toast. &ldquo;Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cottage is located on the Big Bear River. Four
rooms and a boathouse. Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve hired a man
to look after the place and keep the boat in shape. He
calls himself Anchor Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to live at the cottage this summer?&rdquo;
Penny inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I merely bought it for week-end trips. I plan on
a bit of fishing now and then. You may enjoy going
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad,&rdquo; groaned Penny, &ldquo;how can I? These days
I don&rsquo;t even have time to wash my neck. Running a
newspaper is more work than I figured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the address of the cottage, at least,&rdquo;
smiled Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If you have any spare time during
the next three months drive out and look over the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get there somehow,&rdquo; Penny promised, pocketing
the card. Her hand encountered a typed, folded
sheet of paper which she immediately placed in front
of her father. &ldquo;Oh, by the way, sign this for me, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more cheques.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only an order for a ton-roll of paper. I&rsquo;m
trying to store up a few supplies so that eventually I
can publish the <i>Weekly</i> in my own plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker signed the order, inquiring teasingly:
&ldquo;Have you engaged your pressman yet? Their wages
come rather high you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes everything the <i>Weekly</i> makes to meet its
current bills,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;But one of these days
I&rsquo;ll get the paper out in my own plant. Just wait and
see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Parker. &ldquo;My hope is that
you don&rsquo;t fail in your studies before that happy day
arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her way to school, Penny studied the card given
her by her father, and noticed that the new cottage was
situated not far from The Willows. Often she and
Louise had talked of calling upon Peter Fenestra, but
both had been kept busy at the <i>Times</i> office. Now that
a linotype operator had been hired to set type, they had
a little more free time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Louise will accompany me, I&rsquo;ll visit both places
tonight,&rdquo; decided Penny.</p>
<p>Four-thirty found the two girls walking through a
dense maple and oak woods which rimmed the Big Bear
River. A breeze stirred the tree leaves, but even so the
day was hot and sultry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it would rain,&rdquo; remarked Louise, trudging
wearily beside her companion. &ldquo;I never knew it to be
so warm at this time of year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can cool off by taking a boat ride when
we get to the cottage,&rdquo; encouraged Penny. &ldquo;I think I
see the place through the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directly ahead, in a tiny clearing, stood a freshly
painted white cottage. Quickening their steps, the girls
soon arrived at the front door. No one seemed to be
within call, so they pushed it open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>A long living room with a cobblestone fireplace met
their gaze. Beyond was the kitchen, a dining alcove,
and two bedrooms.</p>
<p>As they went outside again, they saw a short, wiry
man coming toward the cottage from the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Miss Parker?&rdquo; he asked, looking at Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>I</i> am,&rdquo; corrected Penny. &ldquo;And you must be
Anchor Joe.&rdquo; Her eyes fastened for an instant upon
the tattoo of a four-masted sailing ship imprinted on
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; agreed the man. &ldquo;Go ahead an&rsquo; look
around all you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise wandered about the grounds, then
returned to find Anchor Joe giving the motor boat,
which was upturned on the grass, a coat of varnish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you might take us for a ride,&rdquo; remarked
Penny. &ldquo;It must be cool on the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure would like to, Miss Parker,&rdquo; said Anchor
Joe regretfully. &ldquo;But I dasn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;er wet now. Not
until this varnish dries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded, and then asked: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sailor,
aren&rsquo;t you? Where have you sailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Atlantic, the Great Lakes, the Gulf o&rsquo; Mexico.
Oh, I been everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise chatted with Anchor Joe for a
time but, although they asked any number of questions,
they gained very little definite information. The sailor
seemed unwilling to tell anything about himself, save
in generalities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well go on to Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s place,&rdquo;
Penny presently remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anchor Joe&rsquo;s varnish brush became motionless. He
glanced up with sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go there if I was you gals,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; questioned Penny in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather don&rsquo;t look so good. She might blow
up a gale before sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not afraid of a little wind or rain,&rdquo; answered
Penny carelessly. &ldquo;Come along, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anchor Joe said nothing more, but his sober gaze
followed the girls as they walked away.</p>
<p>Keeping close to the river, Penny and Louise trod a
path which they knew would lead to the main road and
Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sort, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Penny remarked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wonder where Dad found him? He certainly
didn&rsquo;t tell us much about himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crossing the river by means of a swaying, suspension
bridge, the girls came out from beneath the solid canopy
of trees. Penny paused to stare up at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t those clouds odd?&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Just
watch them boil!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must be filled with wind,&rdquo; declared Louise
uneasily. &ldquo;Anchor Joe said he thought a storm would
blow up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far away either. Unless we step right along,
we&rsquo;ll surely get caught in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we should forget The Willows and start
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never could get there now,&rdquo; responded Penny.
&ldquo;If we hurry we may reach Fenestra&rsquo;s place before the
storm breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking even faster, the girls hastened along the
winding path. The air remained sultry and very still.
The sky, Penny noted, had changed to a peculiar yellowish
color.</p>
<p>Then, as she watched with increasing alarm, a
writhing, twisting, funnel-shaped arm reached down
from the boiling clouds, anchoring them to earth. For
a moment the entire mass seemed to settle and flatten
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Penny.</p>
<p>Plainly they both could hear a sullen, deep-throated
roar as the storm moved forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tornado!&rdquo; gasped Louise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; urged Penny, seizing her hand. &ldquo;We still
have a chance to make Fenestra&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>In a clearing beyond a weed-grown field stood a
white farmhouse, a red barn and a silo. One side of the
property was bounded by the willow-rimmed river,
the other by the road.</p>
<p>Crawling beneath a barbed-wire fence, the girls cut
across the field. The sky was darker now, the roar of
the wind ominous. They could see the tail of the
funnel whipping along the ground, veering to the
south, then coming toward them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never make the house,&rdquo; Louise cried fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will,&rdquo; encouraged Penny.</p>
<p>She raised another wire strand for Louise to roll beneath.
Her own sweater caught on the sharp barbs,
tearing a large hole as she jerked free.</p>
<p>Dust had begun to blow. Trees and bushes bowed
before the first gusts of wind.</p>
<p>Glancing frantically about for a place of refuge,
Penny saw a low, circular cement hump rising from
the ground not many yards distant. Instantly she recognized
it as an old fashioned storm cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get in there, Lou!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running across the yard, they reached the cave.
Entrance was guarded by a door built in the side of the
cement dome. A brass padlock hung unsnapped in the
hasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, we can get in,&rdquo; gasped Louise.
&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Penny tugged at the heavy door. It would not raise,
and then it gave so suddenly that she nearly tumbled
backwards.</p>
<p>The door clattered back against the cement dome.
Through the rectangular opening protruded the head
and shoulders of Peter Fenestra. His face was convulsed
with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do?&rdquo; he demanded harshly.
&ldquo;Speak up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>A FALLEN TREE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Speak up!&rdquo; Peter Fenestra commanded again as
the girls stared at him in blank astonishment. &ldquo;Why
are you trying to get into my cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that wind!&rdquo; cried Penny, recovering the
power of speech. She pointed toward the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tornado!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenestra in a stunned voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s coming this way,&rdquo; added Louise. &ldquo;Let us
down into the cave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of stepping aside, the man came up the stone
steps. Slamming the door of the cave, he padlocked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Into the house!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be much safer underground,&rdquo; argued Penny.
&ldquo;That twister easily can lift a building from its foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I say!&rdquo; commanded Peter Fenestra harshly.
&ldquo;The cave is half filled with water. You can&rsquo;t go down
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Deserting the girls, he ran toward the house. Mystified
by the old man&rsquo;s actions, Penny and Louise followed,
overtaking him as he reached the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get inside!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>The girls scurried through the door and he closed
it behind them. Barely had they reached shelter when
the wind struck the house in full force, fairly shaking
it to its foundation. Windows rattled, a tree bough
came crashing down on the porch, the air was filled
with flying debris.</p>
<p>As a hard object shattered a pane of glass, Penny and
Louise heard a terrified scream from the kitchen. A
moment later a girl ran into the room. She stopped
short as she saw Penny and Louise. They also stared,
for it was Tillie Fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that silly screeching!&rdquo; Fenestra ordered
sharply. &ldquo;The center of the storm is passing to the
south. Now get back to your work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Tillie mumbled.</p>
<p>Still gazing at Penny and Louise, she slowly retreated.
However, as Peter Fenestra went to the window,
turning his back, she made strange signs to the
girls which they were unable to understand. Obviously
she did not wish them to speak to her for she raised a
finger to her lips, indicative of silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>A gate was wrenched from its hinges and carried
across the yard. From across the road came the crash
of an uprooted tree. With a stifled scream Tillie fled
to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stupid girl drives me crazy,&rdquo; Fenestra muttered.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I ever hired her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame her for being frightened,&rdquo; declared
Louise quickly. &ldquo;This is a dreadful storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst is over now,&rdquo; said Fenestra. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
able to go in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise glanced at each other. Peter
Fenestra&rsquo;s remark made it very clear that he did not
wish them to linger after the storm had passed. Without
inviting them to sit down, he nervously went from
window to window, watching the clouds.</p>
<p>Rain began to fall. At first it came in a heavy downpour,
then slackened somewhat. The wind no longer
tore at the doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to go any time now,&rdquo; said Fenestra.
&ldquo;I can let you have an umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still rather bad,&rdquo; answered Penny. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
mind, I believe we&rsquo;ll wait a few minutes longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision displeased the man. Frowning, he
turned to gaze at the girls somewhat critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent you here?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Why did you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was so suspicious that Penny sensed it
was no time to reveal the real purpose of the visit. Instead
she said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father has a cottage along the river. We were
returning from there when the storm broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her explanation seemed to satisfy the man. He
shrugged and fell to pacing the floor restlessly.</p>
<p>The rain presently ceased. Penny and Louise felt that
they no longer could delay their departure. Saying
good-bye to Fenestra, they left the house.</p>
<p>Rounding a corner of the building, they were startled
to hear a light tap on the window. Glancing up,
they saw Tillie Fellow&rsquo;s face pressed against the pane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s signaling for us to wait,&rdquo; observed Penny.
&ldquo;I guess she wants to talk with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stepped into the doorway of a woodshed.
In a moment Tillie slipped from the house, a coat
thrown over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope old Fenestra doesn&rsquo;t see me,&rdquo; she greeted
the girls nervously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise followed her into the woodshed,
closing the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you worked here?&rdquo; the latter inquired
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since I met you girls on the boat. I answered
an advertisement the next morning and got this job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; asked Penny. &ldquo;I imagine farm
work is hard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The work is easy enough. But I hate the place!
That&rsquo;s why I wanted to talk with you. Do you know
of anyone who needs a girl? I&rsquo;ll work for very small
wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of anyone at the moment,&rdquo; responded
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here much longer,&rdquo; Tillie said, a note
of desperation in her voice. &ldquo;Mr. Fenestra is so overbearing
and mean! He can&rsquo;t bear noise either. If I as
much as rattle a dish he berates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he pay you a decent wage?&rdquo; inquired Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars a week. I can&rsquo;t complain on that score.
But there&rsquo;s something about him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;it
gives me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra is a peculiar type,&rdquo; admitted Penny. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t act very friendly toward Louise and me. By the
way, why does he keep the storm cellar padlocked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I wish you would tell <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t allow us to enter it even when the
storm was coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra always keeps the cave padlocked,&rdquo; revealed
Tillie. &ldquo;He goes there every day, too. Sometimes
he spends hours beneath ground. It rather frightens
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think he does there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Once I asked him about the cave
and he flew into a violent rage. He said if he ever
caught me near it he would discharge me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told us that the cave was half filled with water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said Tillie. &ldquo;He has something
hidden down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any idea what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t care very much,&rdquo; returned Tillie.
&ldquo;All I want to do is get away from this place. If you
hear of a job anywhere will you let me know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; promised Penny. &ldquo;Mrs. Weems, our
housekeeper, may know of a vacancy. If she does, I&rsquo;ll
telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a telephone. Mr. Fenestra had it taken
out because the ringing of the bell made him jumpy.
He said the neighbors always listened to his conversations,
too. He&rsquo;s very suspicious of everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can run out in the car,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
blame you for not liking this place. I shouldn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for everything,&rdquo; replied Tillie gratefully.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been awfully good to me. I must run back
now or old Fenestra will ask me a million questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily saying good-bye, she darted away. Walking
slowly toward the road, Penny and Louise discussed
Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s strange actions. They were inclined to
agree with Tillie that he had hidden something of
value beneath ground.</p>
<p>Across the road from the farmhouse a giant elm tree
had been uprooted. They saw overturned chicken
houses, fences laid flat, tangles of telephone and electric
wires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even more damage must have been done farther
down the river,&rdquo; remarked Penny anxiously. &ldquo;I hope
our new cottage hasn&rsquo;t blown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go there and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several hundred yards the girls followed the
road, then once more they cut across the fields toward
the winding river. As they approached the Parker
property their misgivings increased. All along the
water front, trees had been toppled and split. In sections
there were wide paths cut as if by a scythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cottage is still there!&rdquo; Penny cried as they
presently ascended to higher ground. &ldquo;I can see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several trees are down,&rdquo; observed Louise. &ldquo;One
has fallen across the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful birch, too,&rdquo; murmured Penny. &ldquo;Anchor
Joe will have a job clearing it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approaching the cottage, the girls saw no glimpse
of the workman. Penny called his name several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where he went?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>The girls rounded the corner of the cottage. As
their eyes fell upon the giant birch which had demolished
the porch railing, they were startled to see a slight
movement among the leaves. A hand lay limp against
the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor Joe!&rdquo; gasped Penny in horror. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
pinned beneath the tree!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>A WORD TO THE WISE</i></h2>
<p>Penny and Louise stooped beside the groaning
man who lay pinned on his side beneath the tree. As
they attempted to move him he writhed in pain and
pleaded with them not to touch him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tree will have to be lifted,&rdquo; declared Penny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Louise to encourage Anchor Joe, she ran
the entire distance to the main road. The nearest house
was the one owned by Peter Fenestra. However, as she
hastened in that direction, she observed a truck filled
with telephone linemen coming toward her. Hailing
the men, she told them what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Anchor Joe is badly hurt,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone for a doctor while you go on to the
cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the linemen offered to make the call, leaving
her free to guide the other four men to the Parker
camp. Reaching the spot, the men raised the fallen
tree. Carefully they lifted Anchor Joe who had lapsed
into unconsciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him into the cottage,&rdquo; Penny directed, going
ahead to open doors.</p>
<p>One of the rooms had been furnished as a bedroom
with an old cot, a chest of drawers and odd pieces
brought from the Parker home. Penny spread a blanket
over the mattress and the injured man was stretched
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s seriously hurt, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid he is,&rdquo; admitted one of the linemen. &ldquo;Heat
up some water and I&rsquo;ll do what I can until the doctor
gets here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise hastened to the kitchen to struggle
with the wood-burning range. By the time they had
the fire going well they heard voices in the yard.
Glancing out the window they saw a lineman coming
toward the cottage and walking beside a doctor who
carried a light, black bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Doctor Griswold,&rdquo; observed Louise. &ldquo;He made
a quick trip from town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ran to open the door for the two men. Then,
at the doctor&rsquo;s bidding, she went to the kitchen again
for the boiling water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You carry it in,&rdquo; urged Louise. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to see
poor Anchor Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>The linemen had left by the time Penny reentered
the bedroom. The doctor was working over Anchor
Joe, and she observed in relief that he had recovered
consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you feel pain?&rdquo; the doctor inquired as he
unfastened the man&rsquo;s shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My back and chest, doc,&rdquo; the sailor mumbled.
&ldquo;Feels like all my insides is crushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; said the doctor cheerfully, &ldquo;or you
wouldn&rsquo;t be telling me about it. Now let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Anchor Joe&rsquo;s pulse, then gently probed his
chest and sponged a break in the skin. Carefully he
turned the man upon his back.</p>
<p>Penny drew in her breath, nearly dropping the pan
of water. Across Anchor Joe&rsquo;s back was tattooed the
sprawling figure of an octopus. She bent closer. Beneath
the front arms of the repulsive sea creature appeared
a single word: <i>One</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Munn&rsquo;s tattoo was exactly the same, save for
the word!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;It was &lsquo;All&rsquo; while this is
&lsquo;One.&rsquo; What can be the significance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the doctor was startled by the strange tattoo
for he glanced at it curiously as he probed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a sailor?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; muttered Anchor Joe. &ldquo;Ouch, doc!
Take it easy, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could not remain silent. &ldquo;Joe, do you know a
man named John Munn?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I know him,&rdquo; the sailor mumbled. &ldquo;We
shipped together on the <i>Dorasky</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tattoo is very similar to his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anchor Joe&rsquo;s pain-glazed eyes turned upon Penny
as if he were seeing her for the first time. He made an
effort to pull the blanket over his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had &rsquo;em put on together,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Jack
an&rsquo; John, and that rat, Otto&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk to the patient,&rdquo; said the doctor
significantly. &ldquo;He should be kept quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; apologized Penny.</p>
<p>She did not speak again until the doctor had completed
his examination and had bandaged Anchor Joe&rsquo;s
cuts and bruises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you advise, doctor?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Will it
be necessary to remove Joe to a hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither advisable nor desirable for at least twenty-four
hours,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I find no indication of internal
injury, but it is best to be safe. The patient should be
kept quiet, in bed, for at least a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something of a problem to care for him here,&rdquo;
said Penny frowning. &ldquo;Do you suggest a nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any woman who has had practical experience in
caring for the sick would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems may be willing to come,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone home at once and learn what arrangements
can be made.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>When the doctor left, Penny accompanied him as
far as the first house. From there she telephoned her
father, who promised to get Mrs. Weems and come at
once to the cottage.</p>
<p>Louise was uneasily waiting by the time Penny returned.
Outside the bedroom they held whispered consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Anchor Joe talked?&rdquo; Penny questioned. &ldquo;You
know what I mean. Has he said anything about John
Munn or the tattoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. But every so often he mutters that
he&rsquo;ll get even with someone by the name of Otto&mdash;a
fellow sailor who &lsquo;ratted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He mentioned Otto when I was in the room,&rdquo;
nodded Penny. &ldquo;I wish we dared question Joe, but the
doctor advised against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should annoy him now. Perhaps
later on he&rsquo;ll tell us about the tattoo and its meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; echoed Penny. &ldquo;However, if I am any
judge of character, Anchor Joe isn&rsquo;t the talkative type.
As soon as he gets over the shock of this accident, he&rsquo;ll
lock those lips of his. We&rsquo;ll learn nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so convinced there&rsquo;s a deep mystery
connected with the tattoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it, Lou. I just <i>know</i> there is. I&rsquo;ll
never rest until I learn the significance of those words,
<i>All</i> and <i>One</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Within a half hour Mrs. Weems and Mr. Parker
arrived at the cottage, bringing a supply of linen, food,
and comforts for the injured man. The housekeeper
agreed to assume charge until Anchor Joe could be
safely removed to a hospital.</p>
<p>When Mr. Parker drove to Riverview the girls accompanied
him. During the ride Penny questioned her
father regarding Anchor Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know almost nothing about him,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He
was sent to me by the Acme Employment Agency,
and I didn&rsquo;t bother to ask for a recommendation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that he&rsquo;s a friend of John Munn,&rdquo; revealed
Penny. &ldquo;As soon as he&rsquo;s able to get about again,
I mean to ask him a number of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker drove Louise to her home, and at Penny&rsquo;s
request dropped her off at the <i>Weekly Times</i> office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, what about dinner tonight?&rdquo; he inquired.
&ldquo;Shall we dine at the Commodore Hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I wish I could,&rdquo; Penny sighed wistfully.
&ldquo;Work is stacked a mile high on my desk. I&rsquo;ll just grab
a sandwich somewhere and work late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are taking the newspaper business
too seriously,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;Shall I leave the car
for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker gave her the car keys, and walked on
to his own newspaper. Entering the <i>Times</i> building,
Penny spoke to several high school boys who were
working in the advertising office, and climbed the
stairs to her own office.</p>
<p>For the next half hour she checked over galley
proofs, marking corrections on the margins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never imagined there could be so many things to
do on a weekly,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;One never gets through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A board creaked in the newsroom. Penny heard it
and glanced up. A shadow passed slowly across the
frosted glass of the office door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>No one answered, and the shadow disappeared.
Penny waited a moment, then impatiently arose and
went to the door. The newsroom was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Someone walked past my
office door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking that it might have been one of the high
school boys, Penny went to the head of the stairs and
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anyone come up here a moment ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless it was by way of the back entrance,&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>
<p>Decidedly puzzled, Penny returned to her desk. As
she sat down a sheet of paper lying on the blotter pad
drew her attention. She was certain it had not been
there a few minutes earlier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Reaching for it, she gasped in astonishment. The
paper bore a message scrawled in black ink and read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<p>&ldquo;To the Editor of the <i>Weekly Times</i>:</p>
<p>You are hereby warned to give up your newspaper
which offends public taste. We give you
three days to wind up your business and close
doors. A word to the wise is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>MR. JUDSON&rsquo;S DAUGHTER</i></h2>
<p>Penny read the message three times. Obviously,
it had been placed on her desk during the few minutes
she had been absent. Yet she reasoned that it would
be useless to search for the cowardly person who undoubtedly
had slipped from the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am warned to close shop!&rdquo; she muttered angrily.
&ldquo;And the <i>Weekly Times</i> offends public taste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny crumpled the paper into a ball, hurling it toward
the wire basket. Reconsidering her action, she
recovered the note and, carefully smoothing the wrinkles,
placed it in her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show this to Dad,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;But no
one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Penny&rsquo;s anger had cooled she was left with
a vague sensation of misgiving. Resolutely she reflected
that it was not unusual for editors to receive threatening
notes. Often her father had shown her such communications
sent to the <i>Star</i> by cranks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing,&rdquo; she assured herself. &ldquo;Not
a thing. I&rsquo;ll keep on publishing the <i>Weekly</i> as long as
I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One fact contributed to Penny&rsquo;s uneasiness. Often
she worked late in the building, and a single light burning
from an upper story window proclaimed to any
street watcher that she was alone. In the future she
must use far more caution.</p>
<p>Try as she would, Penny could not forget the warning.
After the boys who comprised the advertising staff
had gone home for dinner, she caught herself listening
tensely to every unusual sound. At length she shut the
desk and arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing no good here,&rdquo; she thought in disgust.
&ldquo;I may as well go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking particular care to lock all doors and windows,
Penny left the building. Street lights were
blinking on as she climbed into the parked automobile.</p>
<p>Driving mechanically, she weaved through downtown
traffic, now and then halting for a red light. As
she was starting ahead from an intersection, an elderly
man suddenly stepped from the curb. His gaze was
upon the pavement, and he did not see the car.</p>
<p>Penny swerved the wheel and slammed on the foot
brake. The edge of the fender brushed the man&rsquo;s overcoat.
He gasped in astonishment and staggered backwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Penny brought the car to a standstill at the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt?&rdquo; she called anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; the man murmured in a bewildered way.</p>
<p>As he turned his face toward her, Penny recognized
Matthew Judson, the former publisher of the <i>Morning
Press</i>. Calling him by name, she invited him into the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take you home, or wherever you are going,&rdquo;
she urged. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look well, Mr. Judson. I am
afraid I frightened you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; admitted the old gentleman,
staring at Penny. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was thinking about something
when I stepped from the curb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a dangerous intersection. Please, Mr. Judson,
can&rsquo;t I take you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you insist,&rdquo; he murmured, entering the car. &ldquo;You
seem to know my name, but I haven&rsquo;t the pleasure of
your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Penny Parker. My father publishes the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Mr. Judson&rsquo;s voice became spiritless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your home is on Drexel Boulevard, I believe?&rdquo;
Penny inquired.</p>
<p>Matthew Judson nodded and in the same dull, lifeless
voice supplied the address. He made no attempt
at conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>As she stole occasional glimpses at the man, Penny
thought that his face bore lines of mental fatigue and
discouragement. He stared straight ahead with glazed,
unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>Hoping to start a conversation, she presently remarked
that she was the managing editor of the
<i>Weekly Times</i>. For the first time Matthew Judson
displayed interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you the girl who has taken over my building?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Veeley allows me the use of it rent free.
I hope you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Judson, laughing mirthlessly.
&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo; Penny began to stammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought that because I gave up my own paper
I might not wish to see the building used by another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; admitted Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try not to think about the past,&rdquo; said Mr. Judson
quietly. &ldquo;Long ago I made my decision, and now
must abide by it. I realize that I never can publish the
<i>Press</i> again. I&rsquo;m broken, beaten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man spoke with such bitterness that Penny
glanced quickly at him. There was an expression in
his dark eyes which startled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely one can&rsquo;t be defeated as long as he&rsquo;s willing
to fight,&rdquo; she ventured. &ldquo;Why, if you chose to make a
come-back, I&rsquo;m certain you would succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Mr. Judson shook his head impatiently. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand. I am through&mdash;finished. All I can hope to
do is to hold fast to what little I have, and try to protect
Pauletta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauletta is your wife?&rdquo; Penny inquired kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter. If it weren&rsquo;t for her&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Judson
hesitated, then finished in a voice quite casual: &ldquo;If it
weren&rsquo;t for her, I probably would end it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Judson!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
mean that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; he said, smiling faintly. &ldquo;I have
no intention of taking the easy way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen questions flashed through Penny&rsquo;s mind,
but she was afraid to ask any of them. From Mr. Judson&rsquo;s
remarks it was fairly evident that he never had
relinquished the <i>Press</i> voluntarily. Could financial difficulties
alone account for his state of mental depression?</p>
<p>In the darkening twilight the car approached a
white-painted brick house, set back some distance from
the boulevard. Once an elegant dwelling, peeling paint
had made it an unsightly residence. Roof shingles were
curling, the front porch sagged, while an iron fence
only partially hid a wide expanse of untended lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my home,&rdquo; said Mr. Judson. &ldquo;Turn into the
driveway if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Penny stopped the car just inside the iron gate.</p>
<p>As Mr. Judson alighted, a girl who appeared to be
in her early twenties, arose from a bench. A white
collie at her side, she came toward the car. Midway
across the lawn, she paused, staring. Then, she half
turned as if to retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauletta,&rdquo; called Mr. Judson. &ldquo;Will you come here,
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly the girl approached the car, her gaze
meeting Penny&rsquo;s almost defiantly. Pauletta was a beautiful
girl with auburn hair and steel-blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauletta, this is Miss Parker,&rdquo; said her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; responded the girl coldly.</p>
<p>The instant Penny heard the voice she knew where
she previously had seen Mr. Judson&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;on
the steamer <i>Goodtime</i>! Pauletta was the girl who had
tossed a wig and clothing into the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Judson,&rdquo; she responded.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we met before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauletta kept her face averted from her father. She
met Penny&rsquo;s gaze with a bold stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; she said evenly. &ldquo;No, Miss Parker,
you are mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>OLD HORNEY</i></h2>
<p>Penny made no reply to Pauletta and the silence
became unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay for a few minutes?&rdquo; Mr. Judson
invited. &ldquo;Pauletta, why not show Miss Parker our rose
garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather dark,&rdquo; his daughter replied. &ldquo;Anyway,
she wouldn&rsquo;t care to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I should,&rdquo; contradicted Penny. Deliberately
she switched off the car ignition.</p>
<p>Pauletta glared at her, but dared make no protest in
her father&rsquo;s presence. With a shrug she led Penny
along a gravel path to the rear of the house. Mr. Judson
remained behind.</p>
<p>As soon as they were beyond hearing, Penny said
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need we pretend? I am sure you recall that we
met aboard the <i>Goodtime</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember now,&rdquo; admitted Pauletta coldly.
&ldquo;You were with another girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were accompanied by a young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be something of a shock,&rdquo; said Penny,
&ldquo;but my chum and I saw you drop a bundle containing
a wig into the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bundle caught fast and I fished it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no proof it was mine! You&mdash;you won&rsquo;t
tell Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you can offer a good reason why I
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are any number of them. You mustn&rsquo;t tell
my father! That&rsquo;s why I pretended not to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly wish you would explain. Tillie Fellows
was robbed that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Tillie Fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the excursionists. Her pocketbook was
taken shortly before the boat docked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t believe I had anything to do with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to think so, but your actions were
very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can explain everything,&rdquo; Pauletta said hurriedly.
&ldquo;My reason for wearing a disguise was a simple one.
I didn&rsquo;t care to have anyone on the boat recognize me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Before Pauletta could answer, Mr. Judson came
around the corner of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please say nothing about it to Father,&rdquo; the young
woman pleaded in a whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain everything
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded, and for Mr. Judson&rsquo;s benefit, offered
a few remarks about the roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We once had a beautiful garden,&rdquo; commented
Pauletta. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s in ruin, the same as the yard.
Father doesn&rsquo;t look after the place as he should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grounds are large,&rdquo; replied Mr. Judson mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t try to do the work yourself,&rdquo; Pauletta
protested. &ldquo;It was foolish of you to let the gardener
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny felt increasingly ill at ease. As they wandered
about the grounds, Pauletta kept making disparaging
remarks, thoughtless comments which wounded her
father. However, he offered no rebuttal, nor did he
reprove his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really must be going,&rdquo; said Penny at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
getting very dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson walked with her to the car, closing the
gate after she had driven from the grounds. He stood
there a moment, the wind rumpling his gray hair. Then
he raised his hand in friendly salute and turned toward
the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Judson,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;So discouraged
and yet so gallant! How can Pauletta be completely
blind to his suffering? Doesn&rsquo;t she realize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not regret having kept the young
woman&rsquo;s secret, for she felt that the revelation of their
meeting would only add to Mr. Judson&rsquo;s troubles.
Pauletta represented his entire life, and if it developed
that she had acted unbecomingly, the shock might be a
severe one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that Pauletta would steal,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;She must have had another reason for wearing
the disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was satisfied that if Mr. Judson had not interrupted,
the young woman would have explained her
puzzling actions. Therefore, she was willing to give
her the benefit of the doubt. She made up her mind
that she would return as soon as she could to talk
privately with Pauletta.</p>
<p>The Parker house was dark and deserted when
Penny let herself in with a key. Her father had not
expected her home so early and, disliking an empty
house, had remained away. There was no telling where
he had gone.</p>
<p>After preparing a belated dinner for herself, Penny
spent an hour with her studies. However, her mind
kept reverting to the events of the day. A great deal
had happened. Her meeting with Peter Fenestra had
been interesting. Anchor Joe&rsquo;s mishap worried her, and
she remained disturbed by the threatening message left
on her desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been written by a prowler in the
building?&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Ever since we started the paper
I&rsquo;ve felt that someone was hiding there. It may be a
scheme to get me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before dropping off to sleep Penny made up her
mind that the following night she would set a trap for
the intruder. Taking Louise into her confidence, she
made careful plans. Preparing a tasty lunch, the girls
wrapped and laid it conspicuously on the counter of
the downstairs advertising room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the stage is set,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Louise,
you go upstairs to my office and tap on the typewriter.
I&rsquo;ll hide here and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Louise had gone, Penny secreted herself in a
storage closet not far from the counter. By leaving
the door open she could see fairly well in the dark
room for street lights cast a reflection through the
plate glass windows.</p>
<p>The minutes stretched into a half hour. Louise&rsquo;s
typewriting, at first very energetic, began to slacken
in speed. Penny moved restlessly in the cramped quarters.
She had not imagined that waiting could be so
tedious.</p>
<p>An hour elapsed. Far down the street a clock struck
ten times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>With a weary sigh Penny arose from the floor. Inactivity
bored her, and she no longer could sit quietly
and wait.</p>
<p>As she started from her hiding place, intending to
call Louise, a door opened at the west end of the room.
Instantly Penny froze against the wall, waiting.</p>
<p>A flashlight beam played across the floor, missing
her by a scant two feet.</p>
<p>Penny, her heart beating at a furious rate, remained
motionless. She could see the squat, shadowy figure
of a man moving toward her. Boards squeaked beneath
his weight.</p>
<p>Midway across the room, the man paused, evidently
listening to the steady clatter of Louise&rsquo;s typewriter.
Satisfied, he went to the window where he stood for
several minutes watching street traffic.</p>
<p>As he turned again, the beam of his flashlight swept
across the front counter, focusing upon the package
of food. The man gave a low exclamation of pleasure.
With the swiftness of a cat he darted to it and tore off
the paper wrapping.</p>
<p>Penny waited until he was eating greedily. Then
stealing along the wall, she groped for the electric
light switch. As she pressed it, the room was brilliantly
illuminated. At the same instant, the girl gave a shrill
whistle, a signal to Louise that the culprit had been
trapped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The man at the counter whirled around, facing
Penny with startled dismay. He was a gaunt, unshaven
fellow in his late fifties with shaggy hair, and soiled,
unpressed clothing.</p>
<p>Before he could retreat, Louise came down the
stairway, blocking the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Penny questioned him.
&ldquo;Why did you steal my lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s lips moved nervously but no sound issued
from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I call the police?&rdquo; prodded Penny. She gave
him a severe glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; the man pleaded, finding his
voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call the police. I&rsquo;ll go. I won&rsquo;t bother you
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you been hiding in the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have no other place to sleep, Miss. The
cops chase you off the park benches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was surprised by the man&rsquo;s speech which
belied his disreputable garments. His tone was well
modulated, his manner respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been living in this building a long while?&rdquo;
she asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe six months. I sleep down in the furnace
room. I didn&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hungry, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Penny inquired, less
severely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, Miss. Lately I haven&rsquo;t been eating any
too often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may finish the lunch,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s a thermos bottle of coffee under the counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss, thank you. I surely am obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a hand which trembled, the man poured himself
a cup of the steaming beverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me your name,&rdquo; said Penny after
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks just call me Horney. Old Horney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your real name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark Horning,&rdquo; the man answered reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious to learn how you&rsquo;ve been getting in
and out of the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a key.&rdquo; Old Horney devoured the last bite of
sandwich, and poured himself a second cup of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A skeleton key, you mean?&rdquo; Penny asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss. I have my own key. In the old days I
used to work here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a former <i>Press</i> employee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know it&rsquo;s hard to believe,&rdquo; Old Horney
replied, &ldquo;but when a fellow&rsquo;s out of a job and money,
it doesn&rsquo;t take long to go to seed. I lost my place when
Judson closed down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been unable to find other work?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the past nine months I&rsquo;ve worked exactly six
days. No one hires an old fellow any more. If I could
have kept on with Judson three more years I&rsquo;d have
been due for my pension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What work did you do on the paper?&rdquo; asked
Penny with growing interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a pressman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shot Louise a glance which was almost triumphant.
Her voice when she spoke held an undertone
of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horney,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s barely possible I may be
able to find some sort of work for you later on. Do
you mind writing your name on this paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man took the sheet she handed him, without
hesitation scrawling his name, <i>Mark Horning</i>.</p>
<p>Penny studied the writing a moment. To her relief it
bore not the slightest resemblance to the warning message
left on her desk the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horney,&rdquo; she questioned, &ldquo;did you ever try to
frighten me away from this building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Miss,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Once I tiptoed up to
your office. When I saw you were working there, I
slipped down to the basement again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever place a note on my desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was satisfied that Horney had told the truth.
Yet if he were not the culprit she was unable to guess
who had warned her to abandon the plant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Horney, I&rsquo;ve decided that we need a watchman
around this place,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;If you want the
job, it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not turning me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you may stay. I can&rsquo;t promise much of a
salary, but at least you&rsquo;ll have a place to sleep and
enough food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mighty kind,&rdquo; Horney mumbled gratefully.
&ldquo;Mighty kind.&rdquo; He hesitated and then added: &ldquo;I promise
you won&rsquo;t be sorry you did it, Miss. Maybe you&rsquo;ll
find I can be of some real use around this plant. I&rsquo;m
at your service and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m for you one hundred
per cent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>PAPER PROBLEMS</i></h2>
<p>The next afternoon Penny and Louise arrived at
the <i>Weekly Times</i> to find that the entire lower floor
had been cleaned and swept. Old Horney was discovered
in the composing room, stirring up a great
cloud of dust with a stub of a broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just cleaning the place up a bit,&rdquo; he said
apologetically. &ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind?&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted. Our staff
of janitors has lost interest here of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I set a little type for you last night, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Horney! I didn&rsquo;t know you were a linotype
operator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered the old man, &ldquo;but I can learn
most anything if I set my mind to it. If you have any
jobs you want done just turn them over to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Horney,&rdquo; said Penny soberly, &ldquo;more than anything
else I would like to publish the <i>Weekly</i> in my own
plant. The obstacles seem almost too great to overcome;
do you think it could be accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sure,&rdquo; said Horney. &ldquo;If I had some tools
and a little to do with I could get the presses ready in
a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the stereotyping work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could master the trick of it,&rdquo; declared Horney
confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horney, you&rsquo;re a jewel!&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
place you in charge of my production department, but
I fear I can&rsquo;t give you a salary in proportion to your
duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, Miss. I would rather be
working than sitting around with nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look over the plant and make up a list of the
things you must have,&rdquo; suggested Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over
to the <i>Star</i> this minute and arrange for printing paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Louise in charge of the office, she jubilantly
set forth for her father&rsquo;s plant. Now that Old Horney
had been added to the staff of the <i>Weekly</i>, problems
which previously had seemed unsurmountable suddenly
had become easily solved.</p>
<p>Entering the <i>Star</i> building, Penny went directly to
the stockroom, wandering about until she found Mr. Curry,
the foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something for you,&rdquo; she grinned, offering a
slip of paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Mr. Curry asked with a puzzled
frown. &ldquo;An order for a roll of paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Curry,&rdquo; explained Penny. &ldquo;At last I am
going to publish my own sheet over in the old <i>Press</i>
building. Dad is staking me to a little paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little! Why, one of these big rolls would print
more copies of your paper than you could sell in six
months! And paper is expensive. How about a half-roll
or even a quarter? It would be a lot easier to
handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;Just so I get enough
to print my first issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Curry led the way to one of the presses, pointing
to a roll of paper mounted on a feeding rack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one is about half used up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will
it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;May I have it
right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Curry replied by pushing a tram along a miniature
railway which ran under the press. With surprising
skill, he maneuvered the roll into position on
the carrier. Then he pushed the tram to the elevator,
moved the portable paper lift over the roll, and up it
went to the platform. The elevator grounded at the
first floor where the paper was rolled to the loading
dock with pry bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said the foreman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All I need now is a truck,&rdquo; Penny cried exultantly.
&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Curry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing guard beside her paper she waited until one
of the <i>Star</i> drivers had finished unloading his cargo
and was ready to pull from the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s chances fer a ride, buddy?&rdquo; asked Penny,
jerking her thumb in the manner of a hitch-hiker. &ldquo;Me
and my paper to the <i>Weekly Times</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; laughed the trucker.</p>
<p>He rolled the paper onto the truck, and Penny
climbed into the cab beside him. At the <i>Times</i> building
she had the roll set off at the rear entrance where Old
Horney easily could get it to the press room.</p>
<p>Highly elated, Penny mounted the steps two at a
time, bursting in upon Louise who was busy writing
headlines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;About six hundred
pounds of paper. That should keep the <i>Weekly</i> going
for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something to dampen your enthusiasm.&rdquo;
Louise thrust a letter toward her. &ldquo;Another kick on
that octopus tattoo story you wrote. A Mrs. Brown
says she heartily disapproves of such outlandish tales,
and that she&rsquo;ll never buy another copy of the <i>Times</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least it proves my story attracted attention,&rdquo;
chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Anything else while I was gone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Weems telephoned to ask that you come
to the cottage as soon as possible. And that reminds
me&mdash;the telephone bill. The company requires a
month&rsquo;s advance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the bills,&rdquo; interrupted Penny. &ldquo;Did
Mrs. Weems say anything about Anchor Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He appears to be much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that. I suppose I should drive out to
the cottage before it gets dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along. I&rsquo;ll look after everything here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny swept her desk clear of papers and locked
the drawers. &ldquo;If you have any spare time you might
see what you can do with my algebra assignment,&rdquo;
she suggested. &ldquo;I missed every problem but one yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my own lesson troubles,&rdquo; responded Louise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wading up to my neck in Latin, and the next
monthly quiz is certain to drown me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teachers have no consideration,&rdquo; sighed Penny.
&ldquo;None at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gathering up her school books, she bade Louise
good-bye and left the office. On the stairway she met
Old Horney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made my list,&rdquo; he said, offering it to her. &ldquo;I
figure we can&rsquo;t get out the paper with less than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced at the paper and slipped it into her
purse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the things somehow,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;By
the way, there&rsquo;s a roll of paper on the loading dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already hauled &rsquo;er in,&rdquo; replied Old Horney.
&ldquo;Any other jobs for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you seem to be one jump ahead,&rdquo; laughed
Penny.</p>
<p>They descended the stairway together, the steps
creaking beneath their weight. There was a different
look to Old Horney, Penny thought, stealing a glance
at him. His hair had been cut and his face was clean-shaven.
Work had given him a new outlook, a desire
to recover his self respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you knew Matthew Judson rather well?&rdquo;
she remarked reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he like, Horney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; the old man hesitated, at a loss for words.
&ldquo;Judson was queer, sort of cold and unfriendly except
to those who knew him best, but he was a square-shooter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The employes liked him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone did except a few chronic sore-heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horney, was it true that the <i>Press</i> was making
money at the time it closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what everyone on the paper thought. It was
a shock to us all when Judson closed down. I&rsquo;ll never
forget the day he told us he was giving up the plant.
The old man looked like death had struck him, and
he cried when he said good-bye to the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he closed the plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some say it was because he had lost a pile of money
speculating on the stock market. But I never believed
that. Judson wasn&rsquo;t the gambling type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think he gave up the paper, Horney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a lot of speculating on it,&rdquo; the old man
admitted. &ldquo;This is just my own idea, but I figure Judson
may have been blackmailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmailed! By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;it&rsquo;s only my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no evidence to support such a theory,
Horney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you could call that. But the day before
Judson quit he was in the pressroom. He was sort of
thinking out loud, I guess. Anyhow he said to me,
&lsquo;Horney, the dirty blackmailer couldn&rsquo;t do this to me
if it weren&rsquo;t for my daughter. If it didn&rsquo;t mean smearing
her name, I&rsquo;d fight!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ask him what he meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made some reply, and then he closed up like a
clam. I figure he hadn&rsquo;t realized what he was saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any idea as to whom he meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make a guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what the reason, it was a pity the <i>Press</i>
had to close,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;I feel very sorry for
Mr. Judson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bidding Horney good-bye, she hurried home for her
automobile. However, as she drove toward the river
cottage she kept thinking about what the old pressman
had told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s barely possible his theory is right,&rdquo; she mused.
&ldquo;But why should Mr. Judson submit to blackmail even
for his daughter&rsquo;s sake? Somehow the pieces of the
puzzle refuse to fit.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>AN EMPTY BEDROOM</i></h2>
<p>Darkness was inking the sky as Penny drew up
at the end of the road. Parking her car between
scraggly box-elders, she walked swiftly along the river
trail, soon approaching within view of the Parker cottage.</p>
<p>The fallen tree had been sawed into cord wood, the
yard cleaned of sticks and debris, and only the damaged
porch remained to remind one of the severe storm.</p>
<p>As Penny opened the screen door, Mrs. Weems
came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe is asleep,&rdquo; she warned in a whisper. &ldquo;Perhaps
we should talk outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and followed the housekeeper to the
porch swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he doing?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, much better,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;The doctor
was here an hour ago. Joe is out of danger but must
remain in bed for at least another day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid when you telephoned that something
had gone wrong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed the housekeeper, &ldquo;I was merely
lonesome for news. Is everything going well at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;re getting along fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you remembered to bring in the milk. And
you didn&rsquo;t neglect the dusting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known you would let everything go,&rdquo;
sighed Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;No doubt it&rsquo;s my duty to remain
here, but I feel I should be at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor Joe needs you, Mrs. Weems. Has he talked
very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a great deal. He ate a hearty lunch and seems
in no pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see his back, Mrs. Weems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the cut was an ugly one. The doctor changed
the dressing while he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the tattoo,&rdquo; said Penny impatiently. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you notice it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that he had one, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t question him about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Penny. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you read the <i>Weekly Times</i>? Anchor Joe&rsquo;s
tattoo is a dead ringer for the one John Munn had on
his back. Joe&rsquo;s already admitted that he knows Munn.
For all we know they may be bitter enemies. Perhaps
it was Anchor Joe who pushed Munn off the bridge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, your ideas grow wilder each day,&rdquo; protested
Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense
to other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, Anchor Joe bears someone a grudge,&rdquo;
insisted Penny. &ldquo;He mentioned a person who had
&lsquo;ratted.&rsquo; Didn&rsquo;t you learn a single fact about him, Mrs.
Weems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His last name is Landa and he came to Riverview
three weeks ago. He has no family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll question him myself when he awakens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t allow that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems sternly.
&ldquo;The doctor would never approve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise not to excite him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer is no! Now I wish you would help me
by bringing in the washing. I must start supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny obediently took the basket and unpinned
sheets and pillow cases from the line. She had just
finished when she observed a tall, well-built young man
with military stride, approaching through the trees. He
tipped his hat politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am trying to find
the Parker cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your search is at an end,&rdquo; answered Penny. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
come to the right place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a man working here named Joe
Landa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where may I find him, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe is confined to his bed,&rdquo; explained Penny. &ldquo;Unless
it is very important I am afraid we can&rsquo;t allow you
to talk with him today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I am Clark
Moyer, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;A G-man?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an investigator for the government,&rdquo; he replied,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re after Anchor Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to question him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he done, Mr. Moyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not permitted to discuss a case to which I
have been assigned,&rdquo; he returned, amused by her display
of interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible that Landa is not
the man I seek. How long has he worked here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few days. He&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t killed anyone,
has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled the government man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not that
serious. The man I am after is short and wiry, sandy
hair and blue eyes. He has a tattooed anchor on his
right arm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And one on his back?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know about that. Does my description
fit the man who has been working here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does! Almost exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d like to talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the cottage,&rdquo; invited Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call
Mrs. Weems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summoned from the kitchen, the housekeeper listened
to Mr. Moyer&rsquo;s request that he be permitted to
see the injured man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are a government investigator I suppose it
will be all right,&rdquo; she said reluctantly. &ldquo;But the doctor&rsquo;s
orders were that he was to be kept absolutely
quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only ask a question or two,&rdquo; promised Mr.
Moyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Joe wanted on a criminal charge?&rdquo; the housekeeper
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sent to check up on a man who calls himself
Joe Landa. That&rsquo;s all I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the kitchen came the unmistakable odor of
scorching potatoes. Mrs. Weems ran to jerk the pan
from the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you see if Joe is awake yet,&rdquo; she called over
her shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; said Mr. Moyer quickly. &ldquo;If I
have made a mistake it may not be necessary to disturb
the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; directed Penny.</p>
<p>She led the government man down the hall to the
rear bedroom. The door was closed. She twisted the
knob and pushed, at first easily, and then with increasing
force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be stuck,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The recent rains
must have caused the wood to swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; offered Mr. Moyer.</p>
<p>He took Penny&rsquo;s place, and after testing the door,
gave it a hard upward push. There was a loud crash as
it suddenly swung open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! What was that?&rdquo; exclaimed Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A barricade. Keep back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny&rsquo;s astonishment the government man drew
his revolver before entering the room. Disregarding
the order to remain behind, she followed him inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have expected this!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze swept the room. A chair lay overturned
on the floor. The bed, still bearing the imprint
of a man&rsquo;s body, was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s Joe?&rdquo; murmured Penny. &ldquo;His clothing
is gone, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Moyer strode to the open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he left that way?&rdquo; Penny questioned.
&ldquo;He must have heard us talking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The government man nodded as he stepped through
the opening to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard us all right. There&rsquo;s no question now
that he&rsquo;s the man I am after! And I&rsquo;ll get him, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly examining the ground beneath the window,
Mr. Moyer turned and walked swiftly toward the
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>INFORMATION FROM TILLIE</i></h2>
<p>Penny lost no time in telling Mrs. Weems that
Anchor Joe had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; exclaimed the housekeeper as
she saw the deserted bedroom. &ldquo;He was here a half
hour ago. I know because I came in while he was
sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have heard Mr. Moyer inquiring about
him,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Obviously he ran away to
avoid the interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that means he&rsquo;s guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Mrs. Weems. What do you suppose
he did to have a government man after him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have been a gangster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor Joe?&rdquo; asked Penny, smiling. &ldquo;He hardly
looked the type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any event, we&rsquo;re fortunate to be rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could have questioned him,&rdquo; Penny said
gloomily. &ldquo;Now I may never learn about that octopus
tattoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your tattoo!&rdquo; scoffed Mrs. Weems, beginning
to strip linen from the bed. &ldquo;Anchor Joe
certainly deceived me. He seemed such a pleasant sort
and I was sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still am,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;The poor fellow is in no
condition to be wandering around. I rather hope Mr.
Moyer overtakes him soon. Then at least he&rsquo;ll get the
medical attention he requires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mrs. Weems straightened the bedroom, she
wandered to the river&rsquo;s edge. Only a few stars were
pricking the sky, and it was impossible to see very far.
There was no sign either of Mr. Moyer or the man he
pursued.</p>
<p>Penny returned to the cottage to eat supper with
Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Anchor Joe has gone, I may as well go
home tonight,&rdquo; declared the housekeeper. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
leave, though, until I&rsquo;ve cleaned the cottage and set it
to rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer will it take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I am waiting I may walk over to Peter
Fenestra&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; Penny remarked. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind
seeing Tillie Fellows again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be cautious in crossing the river?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be gone
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She washed the dishes for Mrs. Weems and then
set forth for the Fenestra farmhouse. Frogs croaked as
she crossed the swaying bridge, and far upstream she
heard the faint chug of a motorboat. Otherwise, the
night was unusually still.</p>
<p>Emerging from among the trees, Penny saw a light
glowing in the distance. Knowing that it came from
the Fenestra house, she used it as a beacon to guide
her.</p>
<p>Passing the barn, she climbed a fence and entered
the yard. The house was dark save for a single light
burning in the kitchen. She could see Tillie Fellows
moving about.</p>
<p>Penny knocked on the side door. Through the
window she observed Tillie freeze into a tense attitude
of fear. To reassure the girl she called her name in a
loud voice.</p>
<p>Immediately Tillie ran to open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she exclaimed in relief. &ldquo;I was
frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny&rsquo;s surprise Tillie wore a silk dress. Pocketbook,
hat and gloves lay upon the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I&rsquo;ve come at an awkward time,&rdquo; she
apologized. &ldquo;You were going somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving here,&rdquo; Tillie answered grimly. She
closed the door behind Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean for good? You&rsquo;ve found another job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been discharged. He
didn&rsquo;t give me a week&rsquo;s advance wages either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Penny sympathetically.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll find a better place. You said you didn&rsquo;t
like it here anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hated it. Peter Fenestra is such a suspicious person.
Why do you think he discharged me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess, but I should like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He accused me of prying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unjust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in a way, I was trying to learn about things
I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tillie admitted honestly. &ldquo;It was that
storm cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get down into it?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I tried. Old Peter was gone this afternoon
and I decided to find out what he keeps hidden underground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The padlock wasn&rsquo;t locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually it is, but today he forgot. I got the door
open. Just as I started down the steps he grabbed me
by the shoulder. I was scared half to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Fenestra had hidden himself in the
cave?&rdquo; Penny questioned in astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a trick to catch me prying. He said so
himself, Penny. He only pretended to go away, then
lay in wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he threaten you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he just told me to get out and never come
back. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he leaves here himself
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Tillie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s afraid of his own shadow. But I don&rsquo;t
blame him for being nervous. This house is being
watched!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if fearing that unfriendly eyes were upon her at
that very moment, Tillie went to the window and
after peering into the yard, lowered the blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice I&rsquo;ve seen men hiding in the wheat field just
back of this place,&rdquo; she confided. &ldquo;The first time there
was only one, but yesterday I saw three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure they were watching this house,
Tillie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, they were lying on the ground. For an
hour they scarcely moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell Fenestra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to do it, but I think he knew. All day
he kept inside the house, and I saw him at the windows.
He was as jumpy as a cat. Another thing&mdash;I saw him
loading his revolver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must fear for his life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it, Penny. Even if he&rsquo;s only going to the
barn he carries the revolver with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clock on the shelf above the stove struck eight
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Tillie, &ldquo;I must hurry or I&rsquo;ll
never get away before Old Peter returns. Excuse me
while I run upstairs for my suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Fenestra now?&rdquo; Penny inquired before
the girl could leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Riverview I suppose. He went away right after
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along and get your suitcase,&rdquo; Penny advised.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you into town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks,&rdquo; the girl answered gratefully. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
take me long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Tillie had gone, Penny walked to the window
and rolled up the blind. Across the yard she could see
the disfiguring mound of earth and cement. What
secret did the storm cave guard? Why was it always
kept padlocked?</p>
<p>Abruptly she went to the foot of the stairs and
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tillie, I&rsquo;m going outside for a minute. I&rsquo;ll
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the girl. &ldquo;Sorry to keep you
waiting but I still have a few things to pick up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Leaving by the side door, Penny paused on the
porch for a moment. Carefully she glanced about the
yard and surrounding fields. A thin quarter moon
rising over the pine trees gave dim shape to the barn
and silo. She could see no one, yet Tillie&rsquo;s revelation
that strange men spied upon the house, made her attentive
to danger.</p>
<p>Swiftly she crossed the lawn to the storm cave. As
she had fully expected, the slanting door was padlocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shoot!&rdquo; she exclaimed impatiently. &ldquo;I want
to get down there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She jerked at the padlock several times, and then
accepting the situation, turned toward the house. As
she walked, Penny&rsquo;s eyes fastened absently upon a
clump of lilac bushes some twenty yards from the
cave. They were moving gently as if stirred by a wind.
Yet there was no wind.</p>
<p>Penny did not pause, but every sense became alert.
Her heart pounded. Distinctly she could see a man
crawling on hands and knees behind the lilacs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>BEHIND THE LILACS</i></h2>
<p>Without disclosing by her actions that she
had observed anything amiss, Penny walked steadily on
toward the house. Her first thought had been that it
was Peter Fenestra who spied upon her. However, as
the figure straightened she knew she had been mistaken.
The man was not Fenestra.</p>
<p>Before she could see his face, he moved to another
clump of bushes, and then was enveloped by darkness.</p>
<p>Entering the house, Penny blew out the kerosene
lamp and stood by the window, watching. She could
not see the man. He had vanished completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves that Tillie was correct,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;This house <i>is</i> being watched. I wonder why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she waited, Tillie came down the stairway, carrying
her luggage. Observing that the kitchen was dark,
she paused in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Penny called reassuringly. &ldquo;I blew
the light out so that I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen from outside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is anyone there?&rdquo; Tillie demanded, coming quickly
to the window. Her pallid features were rigid with
fear and her breathing quickened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was someone a moment ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a man, hiding behind the lilacs. I believe he
must have been watching the house&mdash;or possibly the
storm cellar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you see I was right,&rdquo; Tillie declared. &ldquo;Oh,
this is a dreadful place, and I&rsquo;ll be glad to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish you were staying,&rdquo; said Penny slowly.
&ldquo;You might be able to learn what&rsquo;s hidden in that
cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with Peter Fenestra so suspicious. Anyway,
you couldn&rsquo;t hire me to remain even if he would
allow it. I&rsquo;d rather starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no place to go, Tillie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find work. If not in Riverview then I can return
to the country. Anything will be better than what
I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny groped in the dark for the lamp, relighting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how would you like to work at
our place for a few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do if it can be arranged,&rdquo; Penny affirmed. &ldquo;We
have a housekeeper, but it occurred to me that she
might take your place here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be very foolish to give up a good job for
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would only be temporary. I think I can induce
her to make the change for a few days. The question
is, can we get Peter Fenestra to accept her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if he&rsquo;ll hire anyone now that I am leaving.
Why do you want your housekeeper in such a place
as this, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for one reason. To learn what&rsquo;s going on
here. I confess you&rsquo;ve made me very curious about the
storm cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra would watch her every minute, the same
as he did me. It won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will if Mrs. Weems can get the job,&rdquo; declared
Penny confidently. &ldquo;First of all, we must make
Fenestra so uncomfortable he&rsquo;ll want someone to take
care of the house. Is he a good cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wretched. And the trick of keeping a good
fire going is simply beyond him. Why, if we turned
the damper, it never would occur to him to change it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the idea,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hide
the breakfast supplies, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie was quite certain that her friend did not know
what she was doing, but she offered no objection to
the plan. Before leaving the house they altered the
stove damper, hid the coffee pot, and placed salt in
the sugar bowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Old Peter doesn&rsquo;t get his coffee in the morning
he&rsquo;ll simply rave,&rdquo; chuckled Tillie. &ldquo;Missing it may be
the one thing which will make him hire a new housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were watchful as they crossed the yard,
but they observed no one lurking about the premises.
Evidently the man who had hidden behind the lilacs
had taken himself elsewhere.</p>
<p>Penny escorted Tillie to the parked automobile,
leaving her there while she went to the cottage for
Mrs. Weems. The housekeeper was ready and waiting
by the time she arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I nearly gave you up,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Why
did it take so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy finding you a new position,&rdquo;
chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Starting tomorrow morning, you&rsquo;re
to work for Peter Fenestra instead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the act of locking the cottage door, Mrs. Weems
turned to face the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am tired tonight and in no
mood for your jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a joke, Mrs. Weems. I really do want
you to change jobs with Tillie Fellows. You remember
I told you about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not giving the housekeeper an opportunity to speak,
she rapidly outlined her plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Early tomorrow morning I&rsquo;ll drive you to Fenestra&rsquo;s
farm,&rdquo; she ended gleefully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to knock on
the door, and say you&rsquo;re looking for a job at very low
wages. Fenestra will be so desperate he&rsquo;ll welcome you
with open arms. Then as soon as he&rsquo;s off his guard you
learn what is hidden in the storm cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve listened to
your crazy schemes for years, Penny, but this one takes
the prize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will not.&rdquo; The housekeeper spoke with
biting emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; Penny moaned. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
realize how much this means to me! If only you&rsquo;ll go
there, I may be able to get a wonderful scoop for the
<i>Weekly Times</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you never had started that paper. I declare,
ever since you took over the old <i>Press</i> plant, you&rsquo;ve
done the wildest things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t wild,&rdquo; Penny argued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely
logical. I would try for the job myself only I know
Fenestra wouldn&rsquo;t give it to me. Besides, I am kept
busy at the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to play detective for you, Penny. That&rsquo;s
final.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely downcast, Penny followed Mrs. Weems
along the river trail. However, she had no intention
of giving up so easily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;I must take
Tillie to a charity home. She had intended to start
working at our place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl may spend the night with us, if you like.
We have an extra room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie would never accept such a favor,&rdquo; insisted
Penny. &ldquo;More than anything else she wants a job.
Mrs. Weems, please reconsider&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crazy scheme!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny refuted, and noting indications
of weakening, launched into another lengthy argument.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems drew a deep sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why
I allow you to twist me around your finger the way
you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll try for the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. But what will your father say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll call it clever journalism,&rdquo; chuckled Penny.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about Dad. Just leave everything
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the ride to Riverview Mrs. Weems was
further influenced by Tillie Fellows&rsquo; account of Fenestra&rsquo;s
peculiar actions. Gradually she began to share
Penny&rsquo;s opinion that the man might have reason to
fear for his life. However, she could not agree with the
girls that anything of great value was hidden in the
cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Penny conceded, &ldquo;but you
must go there with an open mind, Mrs. Weems. Observe
everything you can and report to me. Particularly
I want to learn what Fenestra knows about John
Munn and the octopus tattoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t try very hard to get the job,&rdquo; threatened
the housekeeper.</p>
<p>At seven the next morning Penny awakened Mrs.
Weems from a sound slumber, reminding her that it
was time to start for the Fenestra farm. Protesting that
the idea seemed crazier than ever, the housekeeper
snuggled down beneath the covers again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised you would go,&rdquo; reminded Penny
brutally. &ldquo;Please hurry, because I must get you established
before I go to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Mrs. Weems was dressed, breakfast and
the car awaited her. She drank the bitterly strong
coffee and, still protesting, allowed Penny to drive her
within view of the Fenestra farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the place?&rdquo; she inquired with distaste as the
automobile halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t dare go any closer for fear Fenestra
will see me. You know the story you&rsquo;re to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one? You&rsquo;ve suggested so many that my
mind is a-whirl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then make it simple. Just say you&rsquo;re a widow, out
of work, and that you&rsquo;re a wonderful housekeeper.
I&rsquo;ll wait here. If you go inside I&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve been
given the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you come for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to see you tomorrow. But hold the fort
until I arrive even if it&rsquo;s a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bundle of clothing under her arm, Mrs. Weems
trudged on down the road. Penny watched her with
misgiving. The adventure was not to the housekeeper&rsquo;s
liking, and it was doubtful that her application for
work would be an enthusiastic one.</p>
<p>Turning the car in the road, she pulled to one side
and waited. Mrs. Weems had reached the farmhouse.
Following instructions, she knocked at the side entrance.
In a moment or two the door was opened by
Peter Fenestra.</p>
<p>Anxiously, Penny watched. The interview seemed
to be taking a long while, but at least Fenestra had
not closed the door in the housekeeper&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Then, to her delight, Mrs. Weems followed the man
into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The job is hers!&rdquo; she thought exultantly. &ldquo;If she
doesn&rsquo;t fail me, I may yet break an important story in
my paper! I feel in my bones that Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s
cave soon will yield its secret!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>THE ART OF TATTOO</i></h2>
<p>At school, during the afternoon assembly period,
Penny received a note from Louise which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Weekly Times</i> is in urgent need of feature
stories for our next issue. Any ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny scrawled a huge zero on the paper, decorated
it with angel wings, and sent it down the aisle. An
answer came immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do something about it. All of our
reporters are taking a vacation until after monthly
exams. Can&rsquo;t you write some sort of story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny considered the problem as she studied her
history lesson. Just as the dismissal bell rang an inspiration
seized her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, I do have an idea!&rdquo; she declared, linking arms
with her chum. &ldquo;How about an interview with Ellis
Saal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; inquired Louise, somewhat dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A tattoo artist who has a little shop on Dorr Street.
He takes passport pictures, too. I noticed the place
weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think the story would be worth
printing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tattooing is a fascinating subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to you. I doubt if our readers share your
enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will when they read my story,&rdquo; countered
Penny.</p>
<p>Early the next morning she presented herself at Mr.
Saal&rsquo;s place of business, a den-like crack in the wall,
barely wide enough to accommodate a door.</p>
<p>Pausing, she stared at a sign which proclaimed that
for a nominal sum Mr. Saal would tattoo or photograph
all comers. In a glass frame were displayed many
samples of tattooing&mdash;bleeding hearts, clasped hands,
sailing ships, birds in flight and other artistic conceptions.</p>
<p>Penny entered the shop. The front end of the long,
narrow room was unoccupied, but the sound of hammering
led her to the rear. A man of some sixty-odd
years was engaged in making a new shelf. As he saw
her the hammer dropped from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Penny in her friendliest tone.
&ldquo;Are you Mr. Saal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; he replied, regarding her curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for bothering you,&rdquo; apologized Penny,
&ldquo;but I should like to interview you for my newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Saal&rsquo;s intelligent but somewhat child-like eyes
fixed her in a steady stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reporter,&rdquo; he said finally in a long suffering tone.
&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t respect a man&rsquo;s privacy&mdash;or anything
else for that matter, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I am sure all reporters respect,
Mr. Saal,&rdquo; responded Penny. &ldquo;Art. From the samples
of your work which I saw out front I am sure you are
a great tattoo artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Saal melted like a lump of butter on a hot stove.
Penny had struck his weakest spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; he said, a faint pattern of a smile
etching his face. &ldquo;I admit I&rsquo;m good, although maybe
not quite the best in the business. What do you want
to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story about the tattooing business in general
and you in particular, Mr. Saal. How do you do it?
How did you start? Who was the most famous person
you ever tattooed? What is your favorite design? Do
you think a tattoo looks better on the arm or the
chest? What&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it, young lady, hold it. You seem to be a
living question mark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Mr. Saal motioned for Penny to follow him to the
front of the shop. As he offered her a chair she took
a quick glance at a row of dirty, smeary bottles of
chemicals on a shelf above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s take your first question,&rdquo; said Mr. Saal,
seating himself opposite the girl. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how
to tattoo&mdash;that&rsquo;s a secret of the profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you charge for one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends upon how much a fellow is willing to pay.
Take this town&mdash;it&rsquo;s a cheap place. Nobody has any
money. The King of England paid fifty dollars for his
tattoo and what do I get? I&rsquo;m lucky if it&rsquo;s a dollar.
And mostly hoodlums to work on. You can&rsquo;t give a
man much of a tattoo for a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever remove tattoos, Mr. Saal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law,&rdquo; the man replied briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Penny in surprise.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crooks can be identified by their tattoos. Oh, it&rsquo;s
easy for a fellow to get one on, but not so easy to get
it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it can be done?&rdquo; Penny persisted. &ldquo;Have you
ever removed one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only man in the state who can take off a
tattoo so it doesn&rsquo;t show,&rdquo; boasted Mr. Saal. &ldquo;The
surgeons have tried, but you always can see where it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about some of the tattoos you&rsquo;ve removed,&rdquo;
urged Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you more than I should now,&rdquo; said Mr.
Saal. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll print it in the paper and then I&rsquo;ll get
into trouble with the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be strictly confidential,&rdquo; promised Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; Mr. Saal justified himself. &ldquo;I never
do any work for crooks&mdash;not me. But if a law-abiding,
respectable citizen comes here and says he&rsquo;s sick of his
tattoo, then sometimes I take it off for him if he&rsquo;s willing
to pay the price. Fact is, I&rsquo;m workin&rsquo; on a mighty
interesting case right now. It&rsquo;s a design that&rsquo;s rare&mdash;an
octopus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not trust herself to speak for a moment.
Carefully she controlled her voice as she said casually:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How interesting, Mr. Saal, An octopus tattoo!
Was the man a sailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an old salt all right, though he denied it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; answered Mr. Saal. &ldquo;I
have to protect my customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about the tattoo,&rdquo; urged Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a figure about so large&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Saal demonstrated
with his hands, &ldquo;on the man&rsquo;s back. Funny
place for a tattoo, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;Is it merely a
figure of an octopus? No words or anything like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two words. I took &rsquo;em off last week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; inquired Penny. &ldquo;What are they, Mr.
Saal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t make sense. The words are <i>For One</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once saw an octopus tattoo such as you describe,&rdquo;
declared Penny. &ldquo;But I distinctly recall that the design
used only a single word. It was <i>One</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Saal. &ldquo;Maybe the tattoo
isn&rsquo;t as uncommon as I thought. But I never saw one
like it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what can be the significance of the
words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asking my customer about it. He pretended
he didn&rsquo;t know, but I figure maybe he and some
buddies had a sentence tattooed on &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that if one were able to read several
tattoos together, the words would make sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Saal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
about this octopus tattoo, but I figure it may have
been that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your customer have any other tattoos on his
body?&rdquo; Penny questioned. &ldquo;An anchor, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t notice &rsquo;em if he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it takes a long while to remove a tattoo.
Does your customer come often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every Tuesday and Thursday night. He complains
because I don&rsquo;t do the work faster, but I tell him if he
wants a good job it has to be done carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Before Penny could ask another question, two
young sailors swaggered into the shop. Ellis Saal,
scenting business, immediately arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful what you write up,&rdquo; he warned as he
left her. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of articles on tattooin&rsquo;, but
not a one that&rsquo;s right. It just ain&rsquo;t possible for a reporter
to write a true story unless it&rsquo;s about a murder
or a fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; promised Penny.</p>
<p>Leaving the shop, she walked slowly to her parked
car. The information obtained from the tattoo artist
both excited and mystified her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Saal could have been mistaken
about the words which were incorporated in the
design,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m equally certain I
wasn&rsquo;t mistaken about Anchor Joe&rsquo;s tattoo. It had
only the single word, &lsquo;One.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Saal&rsquo;s declaration that his customer was not the
possessor of a tattooed anchor caused Penny to wonder
if the person could be Joe Landa. However, the man
was wanted by government agents and it seemed reasonable
to believe that he might seek to remove tell-tale
markings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;Thursday night
I&rsquo;ll watch Mr. Saal&rsquo;s shop. In that way I may be able
to learn the identity of his mysterious customer!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>PAULETTA&rsquo;S EXPLANATION</i></h2>
<p>Penny compressed the facts given her by Ellis
Saal into a brief, lively feature story for the <i>Weekly
Times</i>. She was careful not to divulge that the man
had removed a tattoo from a customer, but to Louise
she confided the entire story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All unwittingly, Mr. Saal gave me just the clue I
need,&rdquo; she declared enthusiastically. &ldquo;It will be a
gigantic step forward if I learn the identity of his
mysterious customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be gained by it?&rdquo; asked Louise as she
slugged a story and speared it on a hook. &ldquo;What will
be proven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m ever going to solve the mystery I must
gather every fact I can,&rdquo; Penny said defensively. &ldquo;I
aim to learn the meaning of those strange tattoos and,
above all, the reason why John Munn was pushed
from the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have your work cut out for you,&rdquo; responded
Louise dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Saal&rsquo;s information helps. You remember I
told you that John Munn&rsquo;s tattoo bore the word <i>All</i>.
Anchor Joe&rsquo;s was exactly the same except for the word,
<i>One</i>. And now Ellis Saal has a customer with two
words on his back: <i>For One</i>. Why, I believe I have
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sprang from her chair, eyes dancing with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have what?&rdquo; asked Louise calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came to me like a flash&mdash;the meaning of those
tattooed words! If we haven&rsquo;t been dumb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly stop jumping around, and explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Saal told me he thought several sailors might
have had a sentence incorporated in their tattoo. That
is, only a word or two was used in each design, but
taken as a whole it would make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think you have the phrase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Louise! Why couldn&rsquo;t it be: <i>All for one, one
for all</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the men were close friends, that would be fairly
logical. But the words we have to juggle don&rsquo;t make
such a sentence, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously there must be a fourth sailor whose
tattoo includes the words, &lsquo;for all,&rsquo;&rdquo; argued Penny.
&ldquo;Then it would fit perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just because four men were pals, you think they
would have such nonsense tattooed on their backs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re right, then the mystery is solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; corrected Penny. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t learned
who pushed John Munn from the bridge or why.
You remember how Anchor Joe talked about someone
who had &lsquo;ratted&rsquo;? The four of them must have
been in on a scheme, and one man betrayed his comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better bridle that imagination before it takes you
for too wild a ride,&rdquo; chuckled Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think there&rsquo;s nothing to my theory?&rdquo;
Penny demanded in an injured tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that if you speculate upon it much longer
we&rsquo;ll never get any work done,&rdquo; Louise replied, turning
once more to her typewriter. &ldquo;These headlines
must be composed if ever we expect to get another
paper on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointed that her chum did not take the matter
more seriously, Penny went to consult Old Horney
in the composing room. The pressman had proven to
be worth many times the small salary which the girls
paid him. Not only had he made the rotary presses
ready for service, but he had cleaned and oiled every
useable piece of machinery in the building. Eagerly
he awaited the day when Penny would print the
<i>Weekly</i> in her own plant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all set,&rdquo; he told her with a worshipful
grin. &ldquo;Whenever you give the word, we can go to
press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Penny praised. &ldquo;Louise and I have
been having a few difficulties, financial and otherwise.
But I hope it won&rsquo;t be long now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She talked with Old Horney about various technical
problems, then returned to her desk. Slipping a sheet
of paper into her typewriter, she composed a letter to
a well known steamship, the <i>Dorasky</i>.</p>
<p>Slipping it into her pocket, she opened the door
of Louise&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind staying here alone for awhile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To mail an important letter. Then I want to drive
out to Fenestra&rsquo;s farm and see Mrs. Weems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after everything until you get back,&rdquo;
Louise promised. She glanced curiously at the letter
but did not ask to whom it was directed.</p>
<p>Penny dropped the stamped envelope into a convenient
corner mailbox, and then drove toward the
outskirts of the city. Nearing Drexel Boulevard it
suddenly occurred to her that she never had found
time to revisit Matthew Judson&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pauletta owes me an explanation for the way she
acted the other day,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I have a notion to
stop and see if she&rsquo;s alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny impulsively spun the wheel, and followed the
boulevard to the Judson home. The iron gate stood
open. She drove through, up the curve of cement to
the house.</p>
<p>In response to her knock, an untidy colored maid
admitted her to a dark, dusty living room. As she
awaited Pauletta, her wandering gaze noted a number
of significant details. The walls had not been decorated
in many years, upholstered furniture had assumed a
moth-eaten appearance, and the entire room seemed
spiritless.</p>
<p>Pauletta came slowly down the circular stairway.
She hesitated as she recognized Penny, but could not
retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; she said somewhat stiffly. &ldquo;Nice
of you to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know why I came,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;We
were unable to talk when I was here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all there was to it,&rdquo; Pauletta declared,
seating herself opposite the girl. &ldquo;Frankly, I can&rsquo;t see
that the affair is any of your concern. I wore the disguise
because I didn&rsquo;t wish to be recognized on board
the <i>Goodtime</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your explanation isn&rsquo;t very satisfactory, I&rsquo;m afraid.
Tillie Fellows is staying at our home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was robbed that night on the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We discussed it before,&rdquo; Miss Judson said in exasperation.
&ldquo;You insult me by suggesting that I may have
snatched the girl&rsquo;s pocketbook! Why should I steal
when my father is wealthy? I&rsquo;ve always had everything
I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like very much to believe you,&rdquo; said
Penny quietly. &ldquo;But unless you are willing to offer a
complete explanation, I am afraid I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if I must, I&rsquo;ll tell,&rdquo; Miss Judson replied
angrily. &ldquo;You may have read in the newspapers that I
am engaged to marry Major Howard Atchley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story escaped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire Howard very much,&rdquo; resumed Pauletta,
still in an icy tone. &ldquo;He comes from an excellent
family, is well-to-do, and in Father&rsquo;s opinion will
make me a good husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your opinion differs?&rdquo; Penny inquired softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not love Howard, and I never shall. On the
night you saw me aboard the <i>Goodtime</i> I had gone
with another friend of mine, Carl Feldman, intending
to enjoy the excursion trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father knew nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I was going with another girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing wrong about it,&rdquo; Pauletta said
irritably. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m fairly well known. I realized that
if I were recognized, Father or Howard might learn
about it. Then there would be trouble, for Howard is
a very jealous person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you resorted to the wig and glasses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was my sole reason. Major Atchley met
me at the boat. Before joining him I threw the bundle
of clothing into the river. Now are you satisfied with
my explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;In fact, I never believed that
you had robbed Tillie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly acted that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, I only wanted to learn the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Judson did not reply. Her cold stare made it
evident that she disliked Penny and regarded her as
a meddler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything else you wish to know?&rdquo; she
asked after a lengthy silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Miss Judson. I was only thinking that I
would like to help you and your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. We don&rsquo;t require assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;but your father
needs friends. He admitted to me that if it weren&rsquo;t for
you he would be tempted to end everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>The words stunned Pauletta. &ldquo;Father never said
that!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. Why, Father&rsquo;s the most cheerful
person in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your presence, possibly. The loss of the <i>Morning
Press</i> must have been a heavy blow to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father wasn&rsquo;t forced to give up the paper,&rdquo; Pauletta
protested. &ldquo;He did it because he was tired of working
so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that what he told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I know of no other reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general belief seems to be that your father
speculated on the stock market, losing large sums of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; denied Pauletta. &ldquo;To my
knowledge Father never gambled. He may have
bought a few stocks from time to time, but only for
investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you feel sure he did not dispose of the <i>Press</i>
because he needed money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauletta hesitated before she answered. &ldquo;It never
occurred to me before, but Father has been rather
close the past year. I thought it was sheer carelessness
when he let this place run down. He always gave me
everything I wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he favor your marriage to the Major?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps money does enter into it,&rdquo; Pauletta said
slowly. &ldquo;Many times Father has reminded me that
I would have every luxury as Howard&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend Carl is poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a fairly good position, but not much money.
Father always seemed to like Carl. That was why I
couldn&rsquo;t understand when he asked me not to see him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure your father thinks only of your welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would rather marry Carl and be poor always
than to have riches with Howard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not told your father that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. It never occurred to me that money had
influenced him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another rumor,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I suppose I
shouldn&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it said that your father disposed of the
<i>Press</i> because he had been blackmailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. It was only a rumor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be truth in it,&rdquo; Pauletta replied in a
low voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve opened my eyes, Miss Parker. I&rsquo;ve
been very blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think someone may have forced your
father to pay money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But Father has acted strangely ever
since he gave up the paper. Once a month, on the
fourth, he receives a visit from a queer looking man.
Always he tries to get me out of the house before the
fellow comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Father has never told me. The man seldom
stays longer than ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you describe him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well because I never saw him at close
range. I should say he&rsquo;s middle-aged, dark and cruel
looking. Not at all the sort Father would choose for
a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father offers no explanation as to why the
man comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. He refuses to discuss the subject. I&rsquo;ve
noticed, though, that for days after the fellow leaves
he&rsquo;s very nervous and uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for asking so many questions, Miss
Judson, but do you know of any reason why your
father might be blackmailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I am sure he&rsquo;s never been involved in
anything dishonorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had no more to tell, and she was convinced
that Pauletta had given a truthful account of the situation.
Feeling that she was not particularly welcome,
she arose to leave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came,&rdquo; Pauletta said, extending her
hand. &ldquo;Please excuse my rudeness. There were so
many things I failed to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must forgive me, too,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to meddle. I truly want to help your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help him, too,&rdquo; said Pauletta in a
troubled voice. &ldquo;In the past I fear I&rsquo;ve been very
selfish and inconsiderate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a way to help if you&rsquo;re willing to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that on the fourth of each month a man
comes here to see your father. If you tried could you
learn his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might drop in upon them at an awkward moment,
compelling Father to introduce me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, but I fail to see what will be gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing, perhaps a great deal,&rdquo; replied
Penny. &ldquo;If the man is a blackmailer, it should help for
us to know his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn what I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then until the fourth, good-bye. And please, not
a word to Mr. Judson. We must work secretly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflecting upon the information given her by
Pauletta, Penny drove on toward Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s
home. A quarter of a mile away she parked the car,
and set off afoot, hoping to attract no attention should
the owner be at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>It was well that she took the precaution. She was
three hundred yards from the grounds when suddenly
she saw a man emerge from behind the barn. At a
glance she observed that he was too short to be Peter
Fenestra.</p>
<p>As Penny paused to watch, the man moved stealthily
across the yard to the front door of the farmhouse.
His face turned slightly in her direction, and she
recognized Anchor Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he be doing here?&rdquo; she thought in amazement.</p>
<p>The question soon was answered. Glancing quickly
about, Anchor Joe dropped a white envelope on the
front porch. Then he pounded several times on the
door before darting to the shelter of the lilac bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>MRS. WEEMS&rsquo; REPORT</i></h2>
<p>Several minutes elapsed before the door was
opened by Peter Fenestra. He glanced alertly about
the yard, and then his gaze fell upon the envelope.
Penny heard him mutter to himself as he picked it up.</p>
<p>Fenestra&rsquo;s face became convulsed with rage as he
tore open the flap and saw the message. Still muttering,
he crumpled the paper and thrust it into his
pocket. Entering the house, he slammed the door.</p>
<p>With Peter at home Penny dared not try to see
Mrs. Weems. As she hesitated, debating, Anchor Joe
came from his hiding place. He did not see the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; she called softly.</p>
<p>The sailor turned. Recognizing her, he ran in the
opposite direction across the yard. Keeping low behind
a hedge, he started toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe! Come back!&rdquo; Penny called again.</p>
<p>Paying no heed, the sailor fled through the fields.
Soon he was hidden by tall trees and bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Penny felt deeply disturbed, wondering if Anchor
Joe made a practice of watching the Fenestra home.
She was inclined to believe that this had not been his
first visit there.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly the farmhouse door swung open.
Penny barely had time to step behind a large maple
before Peter Fenestra came down the path. He went
directly to the barn, and a few minutes later backed
out his automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely driving to
Riverview. Now I can talk to Mrs. Weems without
fear of interruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the car had disappeared down the main
road, she ran to the kitchen door and knocked. When
it was not opened immediately, she thrust her head inside
and called the housekeeper&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Weems, hurrying from
the dining room. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve come to take me
home, Penny Parker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only to receive your report.&rdquo; Penny sank into
a chair beside the stove. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t act very pleased
with your new job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful place. I was crazy to say I would
stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you learned anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that Peter Fenestra is one of the most
disagreeable men I ever met in my life! There&rsquo;s no
satisfying him. He requires a slave, not a housekeeper!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the storm cave?&rdquo; Penny asked.
&ldquo;Were you able to find out what Fenestra stores in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. The padlock always is locked, and
he keeps the key in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does have something hidden there?&rdquo; Penny
questioned eagerly. &ldquo;He goes down into it at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him enter the cave once since I came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night after I had gone to bed. I heard the door
close, so I went to the window and watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did he stay there, Mrs. Weems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three hours I&rsquo;d judge. It was after two
o&rsquo;clock when he returned to his room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>can</i> he have hidden in the cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in my opinion,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Weems.
&ldquo;I think he cooks something. At least he builds a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see smoke seeping out from the cracks of
the cave door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny frowned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess what he could be
cooking,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Surely he doesn&rsquo;t have a still down
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it very much. Probably you&rsquo;ve built up a
great mystery about nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Pouring hot water over the dishes, Mrs. Weems began
to wash them. Penny picked up a towel and automatically
wiped and stacked them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t imagine that this house was being
watched,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Only a few minutes ago I
saw Anchor Joe steal to the door and leave a letter
for Mr. Fenestra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Moyer never caught him it seems. But why
should the fellow come here? What message did he
leave Fenestra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard a knock on the front door,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
admitted. &ldquo;Fenestra answered it, and when he came
back into the kitchen he was in a dreadful temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter upset him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he had received one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Anchor Joe left it on the doorstep. It may have
been a threatening note. I&rsquo;d give a lot to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra has been very nervous since I came here,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems contributed. &ldquo;If he hears any unusual
sound in the yard he immediately becomes alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if he were afraid for his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does act that way. I doubt if he&rsquo;ll stay here
much longer. His clothes are all packed in suitcases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> important information,&rdquo; declared Penny.
&ldquo;Oh, dear, if only we knew why he&rsquo;s being threatened,
and why he intends to leave! I believe I&rsquo;ll go upstairs
and inspect his room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn nothing there,&rdquo; responded Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;Fenestra is a careful man. He leaves no
papers lying about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do no harm to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny climbed the creaking stairs and was followed
by Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is his room,&rdquo; said the housekeeper, opening
a door. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made the bed yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She busied herself smoothing covers while Penny
wandered about. The room had no rug. It was furnished
with an old fashioned dresser, a wash stand and
a bed with a high headboard.</p>
<p>Penny opened the closet door. The hangers were
dangling together, without clothing. Everything had
been packed into two suitcases which stood against
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already inspected the luggage,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Weems as the girl bent to open one of the bags. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
find nothing except clothing. I tell you, Peter Fenestra
is a very cautious man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe it,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;This room is as
bare of evidence as Mother Hubbard&rsquo;s cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you hope to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Penny picked
up a sheet of notebook paper from the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited over that,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Weems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a grocery list which Fenestra made up. He
doesn&rsquo;t trust anyone to spend his money for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Fenestra&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo; Penny studied the paper
with intense interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, I&rsquo;ve seen this writing before!&rdquo; Penny
exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost certain of it. There&rsquo;s a marked
resemblance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A resemblance to what, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to a threatening note I received. I guess I
never told you. Someone left a message on my desk
at the newspaper office, warning me to give up my
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think Peter Fenestra left it there?&rdquo; inquired
the housekeeper, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like the same writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably you are mistaken, Penny. Why should
he have any interest in your paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to the office one day, questioning me
about a story I ran concerning John Munn. I shall
keep this and compare it with the note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully folding the paper, Penny slipped it into
her dress pocket. Mrs. Weems had finished making
the bed and was ready to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned everything I can for you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Now I hope you&rsquo;re willing to let me return home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please stay another day,&rdquo; pleaded Penny. &ldquo;I feel
in my bones that we&rsquo;re about to make an important
discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those bones of yours!&rdquo; complained the housekeeper.
&ldquo;Tell me, how is Tillie Fellows getting along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she tries hard, but I&rsquo;ll admit Dad doesn&rsquo;t like
the arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must return. It&rsquo;s nonsense for me to stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was paying no attention to Mrs. Weems&rsquo;
words. She had picked up the waste paper basket and
was examining the contents. There were a few advertising
circulars, an unaddressed envelope and a crumpled
ball of paper. The latter, Penny carefully
smoothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper hastened to her side. Curiously,
she examined the paper. It bore no writing, only a
crude drawing of an octopus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the paper which Anchor Joe left on
the doorstep only a few minutes ago!&rdquo; cried Penny
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it may have been intended as a warning
to Peter Fenestra?&rdquo; The housekeeper regarded the
drawing rather dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it, Mrs. Weems! Don&rsquo;t you see? The
drawing is a copy of the tattoo which both Anchor
Joe and John Munn had on their backs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does look the same as Joe&rsquo;s marking,&rdquo; conceded
the housekeeper. &ldquo;But what does it mean? Why
was it sent to Fenestra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is clear. That boatman your father hired
is a downright scamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wanted by the government. We know that.
But Fenestra may be a rascal, too. Why should Anchor
Joe threaten him unless he&rsquo;s done something he
shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why indeed? This is a case for the police, not one
for you or me,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Weems with finality.
&ldquo;I am ready to leave here whenever you are. I&rsquo;ve decided
not to bother giving Fenestra notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go now. You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; moaned Penny.
&ldquo;Stay until after Thursday, at least. I&rsquo;m positive everything
will be cleared up by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a little matter coming up on that day.
Besides, I&rsquo;ve sent off a letter which may help solve
the mystery. Please, Mrs. Weems, do this one favor
and I&rsquo;ll never ask another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Until next time, you mean. But to please you I&rsquo;ll
stay until Friday. Not a day longer. However, I warn
you, if I see Anchor Joe prowling about, I shall summon
the sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right with me,&rdquo; grinned Penny. &ldquo;I must
skip now before Fenestra gets back from town. Just
keep your eye on him and report to me if anything
unusual happens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>PICNIC BY MOONLIGHT</i></h2>
<p>Penny had never found it necessary to explain
fully to her father what had become of Mrs. Weems.
She had mentioned rather carelessly that the housekeeper
was helping out at the Fenestra home for a few
days, and he had accepted the substitution of Tillie
Fellows without too many questions.</p>
<p>At breakfast on Wednesday morning, the publisher
waited until Tillie had gone to the kitchen, and then
asked in an undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer is this to continue? When is
Mrs. Weems coming home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday morning, Dad. Don&rsquo;t you like Tillie&rsquo;s cooking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;These eggs taste as if
they had been fried in lard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;Tillie was brought
up to be frugal. She never wastes butter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The discussion was brought to an abrupt end by
the appearance of Tillie. Mr. Parker immediately
switched to another subject, that of a barbecue picnic
which he gave each summer to the <i>Star</i> employes.
Penny had forgotten that the outing was scheduled
for that night at the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you reminded me, Dad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
there with bells to eat my share of roast beef. Mind
if I bring Old Horney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invite him if you like,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker. &ldquo;But
no others. This is a newspaper picnic, not a bread line
as you made it last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After school that afternoon Penny worked as usual
at the <i>Times</i> office. She was busy figuring advertising
space when she glanced up and saw Fred Clousky
standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you busy?&rdquo; asked the boy diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Penny with discouraging brevity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to bother you,&rdquo; Fred murmured, &ldquo;but
I was wondering&mdash;do you have a job for me around
here? I&rsquo;d like to work on a real paper. Being editor
of <i>Chatter</i> is okay but you don&rsquo;t get any practical experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you want a job?&rdquo; inquired Penny. Inclined
to give him a short answer, she thought better of it.
&ldquo;Everything considered,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what you need,
Fred, is to learn about different kinds of type. It&rsquo;s so
easy to get name-plates and various headlines mixed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Fred kept his gaze on his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just the job for you,&rdquo; resumed Penny. &ldquo;You
can sort and clean the type when it&rsquo;s broken out of the
page forms. If you do that well, perhaps you can work
up later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do I start?&rdquo; Fred asked in a crushed voice.</p>
<p>Penny was surprised for she had expected him to
decline such a dirty, menial job. In a far more friendly
tone she directed him to seek Old Horney who would
be found in the composing room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred isn&rsquo;t so bad after all,&rdquo; she thought after he
had gone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him an office job next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny returned to her work. In need of an extra
sheet of paper, she tried to open the lower drawer of
her desk. It was stuck fast. She tugged at it several
times, finally pulling it out entirely. A folded newspaper
clipping dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>Wondering what it might be, she picked it up. The
torn sheet, yellow with age, bore the picture of a
young man. The face was vaguely familiar although
the name beneath it read, Matthew Jewel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matthew Jewel,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Matthew
Judson! Judson as a young man. He must have
changed his name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two column headline drew her attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<div class="bq">
<p>MATTHEW JEWEL BEGINS
TEN YEAR SENTENCE IN
NEW YORK PRISON FOR MISAPPROPRIATION
OF BANK FUNDS</p>
</div>
<p>The clipping, she noted, had been cut from a New
York paper and was dated twenty years earlier. It
reported Matthew Jewel&rsquo;s conviction, following an
admission that he had stolen two thousand dollars belonging
to the Berkley Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Penny studied the picture again. Not the slightest
doubt entered her mind that the young man of the
story and Matthew Judson were the same individual.
Evidently the clipping had been saved by the former
publisher, and in some manner had become lodged beneath
the drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure no one in Riverview ever knew that Judson
served a term in prison,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He came
here years ago with his daughter, and to all appearances
had led an upright life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After perusing the item again, she returned it to
the drawer which she carefully locked. She knew that
the information was of utmost importance. Was it
not possible that she had stumbled upon a motivation
for Judson&rsquo;s strange behavior of the past year? Could
not the data contained in the clipping have provided
an unscrupulous person with a basis for blackmail?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why should Judson ruin his career rather than
face exposure?&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;Other men have made
mistakes in their youth and started over again. The
truth might have humiliated him, but Riverview people
would have taken a charitable attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply troubled, Penny gathered together her belongings
and went in search of Old Horney. Finding
him initiating Fred Clousky in his new duties, she discreetly
invited him to attend the picnic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you mightily,&rdquo; responded the pressman,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not dressed for it. These pants are so shiny
you could use &rsquo;em for a mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about your clothes, Horney. Besides,
it will be so dark no one will notice. Dad gave
you a special invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he now?&rdquo; The old pressman could not hide
his pleasure. &ldquo;Well, if you think he really wants me,
maybe I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wash up while I get the car,&rdquo; Penny urged.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re rather late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within ten minutes, Old Horney met her at the
front entrance. His hair was combed, he wore a frayed
coat, and had contrived to polish his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horney,&rdquo; Penny said abruptly as they drove toward
the river, &ldquo;did you ever hear that Matthew Judson
had been in trouble before he gave up his paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean financial?&rdquo; the pressman inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I meant of a personal nature. I&rsquo;ve been thinking
over your theory that Judson was blackmailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I oughtn&rsquo;t to have said what I did. It was
just my own idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to believe there may be something to
it, Horney. Now supposing that Judson had stolen
money or had been in prison&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been that,&rdquo; interrupted the pressman.
&ldquo;Why, Judson was so honest he bent over backwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was tempted to tell Horney about the clipping,
but refrained from doing so. However, she was
satisfied that employes of the <i>Morning Press</i> had
gained no inkling of Mr. Judson&rsquo;s prison record.</p>
<p>The picnic was well under way by the time Penny
and the pressman arrived at the river cottage. A caterer
had taken complete charge, and with his crew of helpers,
prepared to serve nearly two hundred boisterous,
hungry newspaper employes.</p>
<p>Always a favorite, Penny immediately was surrounded
by a group of friends. Assured that Horney
had found welcome with pressmen acquaintances,
she entered wholeheartedly into the frivolity.</p>
<p>Jerry Livingston, frowning away all other young
men, became her escort for the evening. After supper
had been served, he guided her firmly away from the
group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to hear any speeches,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go look at the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we see it here?&rdquo; countered Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moon to be appreciated properly must be seen
from a sandy beach,&rdquo; chuckled Jerry. &ldquo;Preferably
from a nice comfortable shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking away, Penny raced ahead of him, along
the beach to the suspension bridge. She was halfway
across when he overtook her, rocking it so violently
that she had to cling to him for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, Jerry Livingston! You&rsquo;ll break the
bridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t try to run away from me. Will you
let me show you the moon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know you, Jerry. You show it to all the
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, it&rsquo;s just as a rehearsal. You see, Penny, I&rsquo;ve
hoped that someday I might get a chance to show it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a line you have,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;But I
won&rsquo;t play. As a moon-shower your technique is terrible.
Better practice some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry chuckled and slipping his hand in hers, led
her on across the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t look at the moon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then
take a squint at Old Man River.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I prefer the moon after all,&rdquo; Penny returned,
raising her eyes to the disc of light sailing
serenely through the star-pricked sky. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her reverie was broken by Jerry&rsquo;s voice. His hand
tightened on her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Look over there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther down the river in an open space, the forms
of two struggling men were silhouetted in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Penny cried, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re fighting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to the death,&rdquo; added Jerry grimly. &ldquo;Come
on, before it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>ELLIS SAAL&rsquo;S CUSTOMER</i></h2>
<p>Penny followed the reporter, quickly overtaking
him. Their pounding footsteps were heard by
the two men who abruptly ceased their desperate
struggles. Observing the pair, they turned and fled,
one toward the river, the other toward the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we broke that up in a hurry!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jerry. &ldquo;Wonder what made them run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been afraid we would recognize
them,&rdquo; answered Penny. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think that one
man looked like Peter Fenestra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never have seen him to my knowledge. He was
the fellow who ran along the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other. Fenestra&rsquo;s farmhouse is across the
fields.&rdquo; Penny pointed toward a light shining dimly
from a window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve both disappeared now,&rdquo; Jerry commented,
moving to the river bank. &ldquo;Wonder how the
row started anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra has been threatened,&rdquo; revealed Penny.
&ldquo;Yesterday Anchor Joe left a drawing of an octopus
on his doorstep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been intended as a warning of some
sort. Anchor Joe, and other men, too, keep watch of
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you learn that, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made observations. Besides, Tillie Fellows, who
worked there, told me what she had seen. Fenestra
is afraid for his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Anchor Joe who attacked him tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been. I wish we could have seen those
men at close range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny walked on to the clearing where the pair
had fought. Grass had been beaten down over a large
area, indicating that the struggle had not been a brief
one. A shiny object gleamed in the moonlight. Penny
picked it up, then called softly to Jerry who had remained
by the river bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, coming quickly to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a key, Jerry! It was lying here on the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the men must have lost it from his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may have been what they were fighting over,
Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the key look as if it belonged to a padlock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am convinced this key will fit the lock on
Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s storm cellar! His attacker was trying
to get it away from him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; remonstrated Jerry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re traveling
too fast for me. Explain the storm cellar part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll promise not to use anything I tell you for
the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied that Jerry would keep his promise, Penny
told him everything she had learned at the Fenestra
farm. The reporter asked many questions about the
storm cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you believe this key may unlock the door?&rdquo; he
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try it, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never will be a better time. Mrs. Weems
thinks that Fenestra is getting ready to leave Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry hesitated only briefly. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m with
you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>They were leaving the river when both were startled
to hear the suspension bridge creak beneath human
weight. As they paused, listening, a familiar voice
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry! Hey, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; responded the reporter.</p>
<p>A figure emerged from the trees, and they recognized
Salt Sommers, the <i>Star</i> photographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; everywhere for you,&rdquo; he
complained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted back in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this, a gag?&rdquo; Jerry asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no gag. The Fulton Powder Company just
blew up. Joe, and Gus, and Philips are already on their
way. DeWitt sent me to get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fulton Powder Plant!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed, falling
into step with Salt. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is, and we&rsquo;re late! Get a move on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry glanced toward Penny, remembering that she
too had a &ldquo;story&rdquo; to be covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to Fenestra&rsquo;s place tomorrow,&rdquo; he promised
hurriedly.</p>
<p>Knowing that Penny might try to investigate the
cave alone, he hooked his arm through hers, pulling
her along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back you go to camp,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is no place
for a little girl at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s protests went unheeded. Jerry and Salt
marched her between them to the cottage. Unceremoniously
turning her over to her father, they leaped
into a press car, and were gone.</p>
<p>Hours later the picnic came to an end. Riding home
with her father after taking Horney to the <i>Times</i>
building, Penny was startled to observe a light in an
upstairs window of the Parker house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s in Mrs. Weems&rsquo; room!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was mistaken. Upon hastening upstairs to investigate,
she was met at the bedroom door by the
housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Weems! I thought you intended to
stay on the farm until tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided a few hours would make no difference.
Penny, the place was unbearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By taxicab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you had stayed one day longer,&rdquo; sighed
Penny. &ldquo;Did you learn anything since I saw you last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of value. Fenestra came home a short time
before I left. He was in a dreadful temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he been in a fight?&rdquo; Penny asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a black and blue mark across his cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was right!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny triumphantly.
&ldquo;I wish I knew for certain who attacked him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Questioned by Mrs. Weems, she described the
scene witnessed at the river, and proudly displayed the
key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it does resemble one I&rsquo;ve seen Fenestra use,&rdquo;
declared the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must unlock the cave! Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go
there and find out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weems
firmly. &ldquo;That is, not without your father&rsquo;s permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know Dad won&rsquo;t be in favor of it,&rdquo;
groaned Penny. &ldquo;I simply must go there and get a
scoop for the <i>Weekly</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Penny, you need to be protected from your
own recklessness. Your father must be consulted before
you visit the farm again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either he&rsquo;ll say I can&rsquo;t go, or if he thinks there&rsquo;s
anything to the story, he&rsquo;ll turn it over to a <i>Star</i> reporter.
Whichever he does, I lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I am in no mood to listen to your pleadings,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems said wearily. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
I&rsquo;ll go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grumbling at the decision, Penny went to her own
room. She did not feel equal to a spirited discussion
with her father that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;m on the verge of solving a great mystery,&rdquo;
she grieved. &ldquo;Perhaps the most stupendous of my life!
And now I&rsquo;m told I must stay away from Fenestra&rsquo;s
farm. It&rsquo;s enough to turn my hair gray.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Penny overslept the next morning, barely awakening
in time to reach school by nine o&rsquo;clock. A surprise
oral history quiz caught her completely unprepared.
She missed three questions in succession, and
was told that she must remain after school for a special
study session.</p>
<p>Released at four-thirty, Penny hastened to the <i>Star</i>
office. Neither her father nor Jerry were there, nor
could anyone tell her when they would return. Discouraged,
she sought Louise who as usual was working
at the <i>Times</i> plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such luck as I am having,&rdquo; Penny complained.
&ldquo;Mrs. Weems says I can&rsquo;t go to Fenestra&rsquo;s farm without
Dad&rsquo;s permission, and he&rsquo;s hiding from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would forget that storm cave and
the octopus tattoo,&rdquo; said Louise unsympathetically.
&ldquo;Maybe then we could get out another issue of this
old paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed at her rather queerly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick of
it, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Louise denied, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been fun, and we&rsquo;ve
learned a lot. But there&rsquo;s so much work. It never ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will soon,&rdquo; replied Penny quietly. &ldquo;Our advertisers
are dropping off one by one. Sales are falling,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always can quit,&rdquo; said Louise cheerfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s mouth drew into a tight
line. &ldquo;Fred Clousky would taunt me to my dying day.
I&rsquo;ll never close the plant except in a blaze of journalistic
glory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you just said we&rsquo;re failing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the <i>Weekly</i> needs and must have is a tremendous
story! Somehow I&rsquo;m going to get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing if not persistent,&rdquo; said Louise admiringly.
&ldquo;Oh, before I forget it, Old Horney has
been up here several times inquiring for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More bad news I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say why he wished to talk with you. I
thought he seemed rather disturbed, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sought Horney in the composing department
and pressroom, and even ventured into the basement.
The old man was not to be found. Concluding that he
had left the building, she gave up the search.</p>
<p>She helped Louise read proof until six o&rsquo;clock, and
then telephoned home to inquire if her father were
there. Learning from Mrs. Weems that he did not expect
to come until later, she decided to remain downtown
for her own dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay with me, Lou?&rdquo; she invited.
&ldquo;Afterwards, I&rsquo;ll take you on a little adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to Fenestra&rsquo;s?&rdquo; her chum demanded suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no. I shall do a bit of spade work
by watching Ellis Saal&rsquo;s shop. This is Thursday, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a long, tedious wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consider it well worth the time if I learn the
identity of Saal&rsquo;s customer. You don&rsquo;t care to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I do. I&rsquo;ll telephone Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls dined at a caf&eacute; not far from the <i>Weekly
Times</i> and soon thereafter stationed themselves a half
block from Ellis Saal&rsquo;s shop. An hour elapsed. Several
times they became hopeful as persons paused to gaze at
the exhibits in the show window, but no one entered.
A cold wind made their vigil increasingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get action in another fifteen minutes I
am going home,&rdquo; chattered Louise.</p>
<p>A clock struck eight-thirty. Five minutes later
Penny observed a familiar figure coming briskly down
the street. She touched her chum&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Peter Fenestra,&rdquo; Louise murmured. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;s the one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fenestra was too far away to notice the girls. As
they watched, he walked to the doorway of Ellis Saal&rsquo;s
shop. Quickly he glanced about as if to ascertain that
the street was deserted. Then he slipped into the shop,
closing the door behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>GHOSTS OF THE PAST</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Fenestra,&rdquo; murmured Louise. &ldquo;Can
there be any doubt that he is the customer Ellis Saal
meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in my opinion,&rdquo; rejoined Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible that he went into the shop to have
a photograph taken, or for some other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possible but not probable. No, Lou, we should
have guessed long ago that Fenestra is an ex-sailor. It&rsquo;s
all becoming clear now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish you would explain to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? Anchor Joe, John Munn, Fenestra,
and perhaps a fourth man must have been good friends
at one time. They had their tattoos with that phrase,
<i>All for one, one for all</i>, pricked on their backs. Then
Fenestra must have done something which made the
others angry. They followed him here to get even
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; Louise asked dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchor Joe gave us a good broad hint. Then we
know that he and at least one other man have kept
watch of the Fenestra farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can the man have done to offend them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess that part,&rdquo; admitted Penny. &ldquo;Another
thing, why should Fenestra decide to have his octopus
tattoo removed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who pushed John Munn off the bridge?&rdquo;
Louise added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re as much in the dark as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; amended Penny. &ldquo;I feel that if only we
could get into that storm cave, we might learn the
answer to some of our questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not thinking of investigating it tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t without Dad&rsquo;s permission.
It&rsquo;s a pity, too, because I know a big story is
awaiting me, if only I could go out there and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of one thing. We&rsquo;ll never dare print a
word against Fenestra without absolute proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Penny, her eyebrows knitting in a
frown, &ldquo;it would lead to legal trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deciding that nothing more could be learned by
waiting, the girls returned to the parked car. Motoring
toward Louise&rsquo;s home, they discussed various angles of
the baffling case. Confronting them always was the
fact that Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s reputation in Riverview was
excellent, while Anchor Joe and John Munn appeared
to be persons of questionable character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You never learned why Joe was wanted by the
authorities?&rdquo; Louise inquired, alighting at her doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen Mr. Moyer since that day at the
cottage. I&rsquo;m reasonably sure Joe is still at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be the one at the bottom of all the
trouble,&rdquo; declared Louise. &ldquo;We tend to suspect
Fenestra of evil doing because we dislike him so
heartily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Lou. The best way is to have no opinions
and wait for facts. But waiting wears me to a
frazzle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After parting from her chum, Penny did not drive
home. Instead, she turned into Drexel Boulevard, and
presently was ringing the doorbell of the Judson home.</p>
<p>The door was opened by Matthew Judson. Penny
had not expected to meet the former publisher. Somewhat
confusedly she inquired for Pauletta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter isn&rsquo;t here now,&rdquo; replied Mr. Judson.
&ldquo;I expect her home within a few minutes. Won&rsquo;t you
wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Penny declined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop in some
other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would stay,&rdquo; urged Mr. Judson. &ldquo;I find
an empty house so depressing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Penny hesitated, and then followed the former publisher
to the living room. Mr. Judson had been reading
the newspaper. He swept it from a chair so that the
girl could sit opposite him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how you are getting on with your newspaper,&rdquo;
he urged in a friendly tone.</p>
<p>Penny talked entertainingly, relating the various
difficulties which beset a young publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve even received threatening notes,&rdquo; she revealed.
&ldquo;Or rather, one. I think it was left on my desk by a
man named Peter Fenestra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra?&rdquo; Mr. Judson&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Penny, watching the publisher attentively.
&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by reputation. He&rsquo;s a scoundrel!&rdquo; His voice
grew quite intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me anything definite against him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, I can&rsquo;t. I only advise you to have nothing
whatsoever to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang and Mr. Judson arose to answer
it. During his absence, Penny thought swiftly. Dared
she mention the clipping which she had found in the
publisher&rsquo;s desk? She did not wish to antagonize him,
yet there were many questions she longed to ask.</p>
<p>Mr. Judson presently returned. Penny decided to
risk his anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Casually she introduced the subject by mentioning
that she was using Mr. Judson&rsquo;s former office and desk
as her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I came upon a clipping caught beneath
the lower drawer,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;It concerned a
man named Matthew Jewel. He bore a striking resemblance
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher raised his eyes to stare intently at
Penny. His hands gripped the chair arms so hard that
the knuckles became a bluish-white. Splotches of red
appeared on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matthew Jewel?&rdquo; he murmured at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Judson, but you have nothing to fear
from me. I shall not expose you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The likeness was unmistakable. I read the clipping,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher arose, nervously walking to the fireplace.
His hands trembled as he fingered an ornament
on the shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I searched everywhere for that clipping when I
cleaned out my desk,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone through
every imaginable torture fearing it would be found.
And now I am to be exposed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I assure you I have no intention of telling anyone,&rdquo;
said Penny earnestly. &ldquo;Your past is your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s past never is his own,&rdquo; responded Mr.
Judson bitterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned it. I hoped I might be
able to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told Pauletta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor any other person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson&rsquo;s tenseness relaxed slightly. He paced
across the room and back, then faced Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my life,&rdquo; he said very quietly, &ldquo;I have tried to
spare Pauletta the knowledge that her father was&mdash;a
convict. I haven&rsquo;t much to offer, but I&rsquo;ll give anything
within reason to keep the story out of the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; interrupted Penny. &ldquo;I have
no intention of printing the information, or of telling
anyone. I want nothing from you. But I do wish you
would tell me the true story. I am sure there were extenuating
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson sagged into an armchair. &ldquo;None,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;None whatsoever. I used money which did not
belong to me. My wife was desperately sick at the time
and I wanted her to have the care of specialists. She
died while I was serving my sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you did have a reason for taking the money,&rdquo;
said Penny kindly. &ldquo;You should have been granted a
pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A theft is a theft. When I left prison, I made a new
start here, and devoted myself to Pauletta who was
then a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old was she?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Mr. Judson gave no indication that he heard the
question. He resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth had been kept from Pauletta. She believes
that I was abroad during those years I spent in
prison. Here in Riverview I prospered, people were
kind to me. I made money and made it honestly. The
future was very bright until a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you gave up your newspaper,&rdquo; commented
Penny. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson nodded. &ldquo;One day a man came to me, a
man I had known in prison. He threatened to expose
me unless I paid him a large sum of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you agreed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that rather foolish? People would have
been charitable if you had admitted the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I considered it from every angle, particularly from
Pauletta&rsquo;s standpoint. I gave the man what he asked,
although it cost me the <i>Morning Press</i>. But that was
not the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He still bothers you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll pay as long as I have a penny. I&rsquo;ve thought
of taking Pauletta and going away, but he would trace
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the man, Mr. Judson?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it either Anchor Joe Landa or Peter Fenestra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson&rsquo;s face did not alter. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo;
he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would talk to Dad,&rdquo; Penny said after
a moment. &ldquo;He might be able to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Mr. Judson, growing agitated again,
&ldquo;you gave your promise that you would not tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll keep it,&rdquo; responded Penny. &ldquo;It does
seem to me, though, that the easiest thing would be to
admit the truth and be rid of the man who robs you.
Pauletta would understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Judson shook his head. &ldquo;I have made my decision,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;As long as I can, I shall abide by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing Penny could do but bid Mr. Judson
good evening and leave the house. His secret
troubled her. If he had told her the entire truth, it
seemed very foolish of him to meet the demands of a
blackmailer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Mr. Judson did tell me everything?&rdquo;
she mused. &ldquo;I had a feeling that he was keeping something
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car rolled into the driveway of the Parker
home. As Penny jumped out to open the garage doors,
a man, who had been sitting on the back doorstep,
arose. His face was hidden, but she knew it was not
her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she called uneasily.</p>
<p>The voice was reassuring. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Horney, Miss Penny.
I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; she asked, hurrying to
meet him. &ldquo;I hope nothing bad has happened at the
<i>Times</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine there. I&rsquo;ve got a letter I thought
you would want to see right away. Found it tonight
when I was sweeping up. It answers a lot of questions
you&rsquo;ve been askin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took the paper from Old Horney&rsquo;s gnarled
hand. &ldquo;Not about Matthew Judson?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; encouraged the pressman.
&ldquo;Judson was blackmailed just as I always thought.
And by the man who signed this letter.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>PENNY&rsquo;S PLIGHT</i></h2>
<p>It was too dark for Penny to read the letter. Stepping
to the car, she switched on the headlights and
held the paper in its brilliant beam.</p>
<p>The letter read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<p>Dear Matthew:</p>
<p>Sorry to bother you again, Old Pal, but I know
you&rsquo;re always willing to give an old buddy and
cellmate a helping hand. I don&rsquo;t want to tip off the
New York cops where you are, and you can trust
me to keep mum if you come through with another
six thousand. This is my last request.</p>
<p class="jr">Peter F.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Fenestra!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s no
surprise either! Horney, where did you find this
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in a pile of rubbish down in the basement. I
don&rsquo;t know how it got there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Fenestra has a habit of leaving notes on Mr.
Judson&rsquo;s desk,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;This one may have
blown off and been swept out without the publisher
seeing it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you figure it&rsquo;s a blackmail attempt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is, Horney. You&rsquo;ve not shown the
letter to anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to you. From the threat I dope it out that
Judson was sent to prison years ago, and he&rsquo;s still
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded as she placed the letter in her pocketbook.
His guess was a shrewd one, but she could tell
him nothing without breaking her promise to Mr.
Judson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horney,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a great deal hinges upon this
letter. You&rsquo;ll not tell anyone what you&rsquo;ve learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll keep it to myself. I&rsquo;m not one to get Judson
into trouble. He&rsquo;s had enough of it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny noticed that her father&rsquo;s car was not in the
garage. She reasoned that since he had not come home
he must be working late at the <i>Star</i> office as he frequently
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in, Horney,&rdquo; she invited, swinging wide the
car door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going downtown to find Dad. I&rsquo;ll give
you a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was grateful that the pressman had little to say
as they sped through dimly lighted residential streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>How much he suspected she could only guess. But the
letter had made it clear to her that the former publisher
never had completed his prison sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was why he didn&rsquo;t answer me when I asked
about Pauletta&rsquo;s age!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He must have escaped
from prison soon after he was sent there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No longer did Penny wonder why Mr. Judson had
not refused Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s repeated demands for
money. Obviously he had feared a far worse fate than
exposure&mdash;return to the New York state prison.</p>
<p>The car turned into the deserted <i>Star</i> loading dock.
Few lights were visible in the building, for the day
staff had gone home and only the scrub women were
at work. Penny could not see the windows of her
father&rsquo;s office from the street. Nor did she observe a
man who slouched against a wall, not far from where
the car had stopped.</p>
<p>Old Horney stepped from the running board,
thanking Penny for the ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll amble up the street and get a cup of
coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure not to mention the letter?&rdquo; Penny
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell a soul. You know, I was thinkin&rsquo; about
it as we rode downtown. Peter Fenestra came into the
office a couple of times just before Judson closed the
plant. He was a dirty blackmailer, all right! Wouldn&rsquo;t
that letter I gave you be enough to send him up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so, Horney. But the problem is how
to take care of him without ruining Mr. Judson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better show the letter to your father,&rdquo; advised the
pressman. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll have some ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tipping his hat, Old Horney moved briskly away.</p>
<p>Penny entered the rear vestibule, speaking to three
scrub women who were locking up their cleaning
equipment before leaving the building. Not even the
elevator man was on duty, so she climbed the stairs.
Switching on a light in the newsroom, she passed
through it to her father&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The room was dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;I was afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deciding to telephone home, she entered one of the
glass enclosed booths at the end of the newsroom. As
she lifted the receiver, a voice from behind her said
distinctly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled, Penny whirled around. Peter Fenestra
stood in the doorway of the booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of there!&rdquo; he ordered harshly.</p>
<p>Penny obeyed with alacrity as she tried to gather
her wits. The building was practically deserted, and
Fenestra took care to stand between her and the outside
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; she demanded coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared at him blankly. Her astonishment was
genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Fenestra said
harshly. &ldquo;I want the letter you and that old man were
talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Light broke upon Penny. &ldquo;So you heard our
conversation! You were listening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to be standing in the loading dock. I
know you have the letter. Hand it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny backed a few steps away toward her father&rsquo;s
office. &ldquo;So you admit you wrote it?&rdquo; she challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit nothing. But I want that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not get it,&rdquo; Penny defied him. &ldquo;Peter
Fenestra, you were the one who put that warning
note on my desk a few days ago! And I know why,
too! You were afraid I&rsquo;d learn too much about the
octopus tattoo. Well, I&rsquo;ve learned plenty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fenestra&rsquo;s face became contorted with rage. He
choked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been down in the cave!&rdquo; and started
toward Penny.</p>
<p>Thoroughly frightened, she eluded his grasp. Running
into her father&rsquo;s office, she slammed the door.
Bracing her body against it, she managed to turn the
key before Fenestra could force it open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of there!&rdquo; he shouted furiously. &ldquo;Come
out, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted Penny. &ldquo;Just try to
get in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed her father&rsquo;s heavy desk across the room,
placing it in front of the door.</p>
<p>Fenestra rattled the handle several times, and threw
his body against the panel once or twice. Then she
heard footsteps as he walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a trick to get me to come out,&rdquo; thought
Penny. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be stupid enough to fall into his trap.
I&rsquo;ll stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking to the window, she gazed down. Cars were
passing along the street. If she shouted for help someone
might hear her. However, to explain her predicament
would be rather awkward.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze fell upon the telephone which had
fallen from the desk to the floor. Picking it up, she
dialed the number of her own house. Mrs. Weems
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Penny cheerfully, &ldquo;Dad hasn&rsquo;t come
home yet by any chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just now driving into the garage,&rdquo; the housekeeper
replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Penny heard her father&rsquo;s voice at
the other end of the wire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down at your office, sitting
behind some barbed wire entanglements. I wish you&rsquo;d
get a policeman and see what you can do about rescuing
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this one of your jokes?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded.</p>
<p>Fearful that her father would hang up the receiver,
Penny talked fast and to the point. Mr. Parker assured
her he would come without a moment&rsquo;s delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that will teach Peter Fenestra not to get
funny with me!&rdquo; she congratulated herself. &ldquo;It pays to
do a little thinking. Fenestra will be arrested, and then
I&rsquo;ll drive out and learn what he hides in his cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sniffed the air. She could smell smoke, and
she thought it must be coming from a cigarette. Evidently
Fenestra had stolen to the door and was patiently
waiting for her to emerge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a long wait,&rdquo; she chuckled.</p>
<p>Gradually her elation died. The odor of smoke had
grown stronger. She saw a wisp of it filter beneath the
door crack. Penny&rsquo;s heart caught in her throat.
Tensely she listened. Was it imagination or could she
hear the crackle of flames?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra may be burning the papers of a scrap
basket just to smoke me out,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Probably
that&rsquo;s just what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Pulling the heavy desk away from the door, she
stood with her ear against the panel. Distinctly she
could hear the crackle of flames. The wood felt warm
to her cheek.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny was afraid. Frantically she turned
the key in the lock.</p>
<p>The door swung outward to the pressure of her
shoulder. A wave of heat rushed in.</p>
<p>Penny staggered backward, horrified by the sight
which met her eyes. At the end of the newsroom,
where the exit should have been, rose a towering barrier
of flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>A BARRIER OF FLAMES</i></h2>
<p>Escape through the newsroom was cut off.
Panic seized Penny, but only for an instant. Retreating,
she telephoned the fire department. Then finding
a chemical extinguisher, she began fighting the flames.</p>
<p>Black, rolling smoke billowed into her face, choking
and blinding her. The heat drove her back.</p>
<p>From far down the street came the wail of a siren.
Penny rushed to a window. A pumper and a hook-and-ladder
truck swung around the corner, lurching to a
stop.</p>
<p>Raising the sash, she stepped out onto the ledge,
waving to the men below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; shouted a fireman. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ladder shot up, but Penny did not wait to be
carried to safety. Before a fireman could mount, she
scrambled down with the agility of a monkey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fire started in the newsroom,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s already spread into the composing department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone else in the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. There were three scrub women,
but they&rsquo;re probably out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lines of hose were stretched to the hydrants, and
streams of water began to play on the flames. A crowd,
following in the wake of the fire engines, was ordered
back by the police. One young man broke through,
darting to Penny&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, how did it start?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Why,
Penny, your hair is singed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in it,&rdquo; she said briefly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain now,
but the fire was started by Peter Fenestra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. He was smoking a
cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. I&rsquo;m waiting for Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A car inched through the crowd, stopping a few
yards away. Mr. Parker leaped out and ran toward the
burning building. He was stopped at the entrance by a
fireman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in there!&rdquo; the publisher shouted, trying to
free himself. &ldquo;My daughter&rsquo;s inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, here I am, Dad!&rdquo; Penny cried, grasping his
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker said no word, but he pulled her to him
in a rough embrace. The next moment he was trying
once more to enter the building, intending to save
important papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Parker,&rdquo; advised the fireman, barring
the door with his hose. &ldquo;The smoke&rsquo;s bad in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the building go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save most of it,&rdquo; the fireman assured him
confidently.</p>
<p>Penny plucked at her father&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Dad,
oughtn&rsquo;t the police be sent after Peter Fenestra? He&rsquo;s
responsible for this, and a lot of other things, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Fenestra set the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the roar of flames, Penny tersely disclosed
how the man had compelled her to take refuge in the
inner office room. Jerry also heard the story, and when
she had finished, he said to Mr. Parker:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief, let me take a couple of policemen and nail
that fellow! Maybe we can arrest him at the farm before
he makes a get-away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; urged Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going along,&rdquo; declared Penny, and darted
away before her father could stop her.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, with a police cruiser dispatched
to Fenestra&rsquo;s place, she and Jerry drove there
in Mr. Parker&rsquo;s car. Parking some distance down the
road, they walked cautiously toward the farmhouse
which loomed dark against the sky. No lights burned
in the windows. The grounds appeared deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if Fenestra isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; observed Jerry.
&ldquo;No use waiting for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boldly going to the front door he pounded on it,
ordering in a loud voice: &ldquo;Open up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; said Penny after a moment. &ldquo;Unless
perhaps he&rsquo;s hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place looks deserted to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced toward the storm cave, remembering
that she had the key to the padlock in her pocket. Jerry
read her thought, and followed as she went quickly
toward the mound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked,&rdquo; he said, indicating the padlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo; Eagerly Penny offered it to Jerry.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this must be the one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter gave her a flashlight to hold while he
tried to fit the key into the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no go, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was so sure, Jerry.&rdquo; She stooped to examine
the padlock. &ldquo;Well, no wonder! It&rsquo;s been changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re out of luck until the police get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any way we can open it ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be tools in the barn, Jerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can find.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Leaving Penny, the reporter disappeared in the direction
of the barn. Extinguishing the flashlight, she
patiently waited.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was startled to hear running footsteps.
Barely had she crouched behind the storm cave before
a man emerged from among the pine trees adjoining
the road. It was Peter Fenestra and he was breathing
hard.</p>
<p>Straight toward the cave he ran. Pausing at the slanting
door, he peered quickly about, and then fumbled
with the padlock. In desperate haste he jerked it loose,
swung back the hinged door, and descended the stone
steps.</p>
<p>Penny waited a moment, then crept to the entrance.</p>
<p>Fenestra had not taken time to lower the door behind
him. A light shone from an underground room at one
side of the main passageway, and she could hear the
man&rsquo;s heavy boots scuffing on a cement floor.</p>
<p>Penny considered going after Jerry and decided
against it. Fenestra&rsquo;s frantic haste suggested that he
might not linger long in the cave. What could he be
doing beneath ground?</p>
<p>With Jerry so near, she felt that it would not be too
dangerous to investigate. Warily she tiptoed down the
steps.</p>
<p>A low, rounding doorway opened from the descending
passage. Peering into the dimly lighted room,
Penny did not immediately see Peter Fenestra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Instead her gaze roved about the walls of what appeared
to be a workshop. Tools were neatly arranged
over a bench, while a cupboard of shelves contained
miscellaneous mechanical parts.</p>
<p>At the far end of the cave stood an urn-like contrivance
which the girl took to be an electric furnace.
An armored cable ran from it to a heavy wall switch
having two blades and a sizable wooden handle. Plainly
it was designed to carry a very heavy current.</p>
<p>Peter Fenestra came from behind the furnace.
Penny saw him throw the switch. Almost immediately
she heard a low hissing sound from the interior of the
metal oven. Slowly the furnace heated, and soon
glowed weirdly.</p>
<p>As she pondered what the man could be intending
to do, she heard a slight sound at the stairway entrance.
Thinking that Jerry had returned, she started up the
steps. Not one figure but three loomed in the doorway!</p>
<p>Penny flattened herself against the dirt wall. But she
could not avoid being seen. A flashlight beam focused
upon her, and the next instant a revolver muzzle bit
into her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; she was ordered in a whisper. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t be hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Penny stared into the grim face of Anchor Joe. Behind
him came John Munn, and a man she had never
seen before. In a flash she knew why they were there&mdash;to
avenge themselves upon Peter Fenestra.</p>
<p>Quietly as the men had moved, they had been heard
in the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Fenestra called sharply.</p>
<p>John Munn and Anchor Joe stepped into the rectangle
of light, their revolvers trained upon the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just three of your old pals, Otto,&rdquo; drawled Anchor
Joe. &ldquo;Reach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Joe, you got me all wrong,&rdquo; Peter Fenestra
whined. &ldquo;I can explain why I kept the gold. I&rsquo;ll give it
all to you if that&rsquo;s what you want. I&rsquo;ll do anything&mdash;don&rsquo;t
shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shootin&rsquo; would be too good for you,&rdquo; retorted
Anchor Joe. &ldquo;We got other plans.&rdquo; His face was dark
with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we know how to deal with a traitor,&rdquo; added
John Munn, deftly whisking a revolver from Fenestra&rsquo;s
hip pocket. &ldquo;You thought you could hide from
us. You thought by changing your name, and coming
to this out-of-the-way town you could fool us. Why,
you dirty rat, you even thought you could get by with
pushing me off a bridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your greed kept you here,&rdquo; taunted Anchor Joe.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave any of those gold bars
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you&rsquo;d melt down the last of &rsquo;em tonight
and skip,&rdquo; added John Munn. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; on
a long trip all right, but with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pair of steel cuffs were slipped over Fenestra&rsquo;s
wrists. Speedily, the sailors searched the cave, gathering
up several bags of what Penny assumed to be gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this bar?&rdquo; John Munn asked his companions.
&ldquo;Can we handle it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too heavy,&rdquo; answered Anchor Joe. &ldquo;With Moyer
hot on our trail, we&rsquo;ve got to travel light. Get going
and I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Munn and his companion marched Peter Fenestra
from the cave. Taking a cord from his pocket, Anchor
Joe bound Penny&rsquo;s hands and feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tying &rsquo;em loose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll leave the
cave door open. After we&rsquo;re gone you can yell for
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, where are you taking Fenestra? What has he
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailor did not answer. Seizing a bag of gold, he
slung it over his shoulder and went quickly up the
stairs. Penny was left in the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>SAILORS&rsquo; REVENGE</i></h2>
<p>Minutes later, Jerry, returning from the barn,
heard Penny&rsquo;s muffled scream for help. Descending
into the cave he immediately freed her and learned
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenestra used this furnace for melting down gold
all right!&rdquo; he exclaimed, peering into the dark cavern.
&ldquo;Wonder where he got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be stolen gold&mdash;government gold, perhaps,&rdquo;
gasped Penny. &ldquo;Jerry, those men have been
gone only a minute or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe we can get &rsquo;em yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had heard an automobile turn into the yard.
Hopeful that it might be the awaited authorities, he
and Penny ran up the stone steps. To their joy they
saw that it was the police cruiser.</p>
<p>In terse sentences they told their story to the officers.
Penny had no idea which direction the men had
gone, but the reporter recalled having seen a group
of four walking toward the river just as he had left
the barn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>With Jerry and Penny standing on the running
board, the police car headed in the direction of the
Big Bear. Suddenly a series of explosive sounds were
heard, staccato noises similar to the back-firing of an
automobile exhaust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shots!&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry. &ldquo;From the river, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car drew to a halt. The policemen leaped out
and started across the fields. Disregarding orders to
remain behind, Penny and Jerry followed.</p>
<p>Breathlessly, they reached the rim of the river. A
beam of light directed their gaze to the opposite shore.
A high-powered motor boat had pulled away and was
fast gathering speed. Flashes of gunfire from its decks
were answered by the revolvers of men on the river
bank.</p>
<p>Shielding Penny with his body, Jerry drew her behind
a tree. In a moment as the motor boat passed beyond
range, firing ceased. Then they slid down the
bank to learn what had occurred.</p>
<p>Penny saw that Peter Fenestra had been captured.
He was handcuffed to Mr. Moyer, and she instantly
guessed that the other four men were government operatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Find a boat and start after those three sailors who
got away!&rdquo; Moyer ordered his men tersely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
this fellow to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny edged forward, obtaining an excellent view
of Peter Fenestra&rsquo;s downcast face. Quietly she made
her accusations, telling of the cave where she had been
imprisoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was how the gold was melted down,&rdquo; commented
Moyer.</p>
<p>He then explained that for days his operatives had
watched the river where they knew Anchor Joe had
hidden a motorboat. Surprised in the act of taking off,
the sailors had exchanged shots with the government
men, but by abandoning Fenestra and the gold, they
had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man&rsquo;s real name is Otto Franey,&rdquo; Moyer revealed,
indicating Fenestra. &ldquo;He and the three sailors
were shipmates aboard the <i>Dorasky</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wanted for stealing gold?&rdquo; questioned
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they got away with four gold bars taken from
the <i>Dorasky</i>. You see, about a year ago a consignment
of gold was shipped by a Swiss bank to the New York
Federal Reserve. Because of heavy fog the bars were
unloaded at the pier instead of being taken off at
Quarantine. They were removed in a sling and
dumped on the wharf to await the mail truck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the four sailors saw a chance to steal some of
the bars?&rdquo; questioned Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, how they accomplished it we don&rsquo;t know. But
hours later a mail driver refused to sign for one of the
bags because it had been slit open. Four bars valued at
approximately fourteen thousand dollars each were
missing. Investigation disclosed that a sailor, Otto
Franey, had jumped ship. A few days later Joe Landa,
John Munn and Jack Guenther also disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each man was marked with an octopus tattoo,
wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Penny inquired eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, although I did not learn that until a day or so
ago. Otto has been trying to get his tattoo removed so
that it would be harder to trace him. The four sailors
had their backs marked with an octopus design and
words which read, <i>All for one, one for all</i>, when put
together. They were feeling very friendly toward each
other at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was right!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;And the
four conspired to steal the gold bars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otto was entrusted by his pals to dispose of the
stolen gold. Instead, he gave them the slip and tried
to keep it for himself. Evidently he rigged up a furnace
and melted the metal into useable form. But the three
sailors trailed him here, determined to avenge themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>As Fenestra was hustled to a waiting car, Penny told
Mr. Moyer everything she knew about the prisoner,
save his connection with Matthew Judson. Deliberately
she withheld information about the blackmail
plot.</p>
<p>While the prisoner was being loaded into the government
car, another automobile drew up nearby. Recognizing
Mr. Parker at the wheel, Penny and Jerry
ran to tell him the latest news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead, Chief!&rdquo; exclaimed the reporter,
sliding into the front seat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a big story by
the tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of good it does us,&rdquo; responded the publisher
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the firemen failed to save the <i>Star</i> building?&rdquo;
Penny asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building&rsquo;s saved, but considerable damage was
done by fire and water. We can&rsquo;t use the plant for
several days. It&rsquo;s enough to make a man ill! Scooped
by the opposition when the story is ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget the little <i>Weekly Times</i>,&rdquo; reminded
Penny. &ldquo;Old Homey has everything ready to roll. I&rsquo;m
turning the plant over to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; Mr. Parker did not understand her meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, gather your mechanical force. The plant&rsquo;s
yours for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;re the tops!&rdquo; the publisher exclaimed,
starting the car with a lurch. &ldquo;Together we&rsquo;ll get out
an extra that will be an extra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Penny lost all sense of time as events
transpired with rapidity and precision. As if by magic
the staff of the <i>Star</i> appeared to take over the <i>Times</i>
plant. The building shook off its lethargy and machinery
began to turn.</p>
<p>Allowing Jerry to write the big story, Penny tried
to be everywhere at once. She fluttered at DeWitt&rsquo;s
elbow as he drew a dummy of the front page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it 96-point type,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Splashy!
A double column story with a break-over to page
three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you say,&rdquo; was DeWitt&rsquo;s surprising answer.</p>
<p>In the composing room, printers were locking the
forms, using pages previously made ready for the next
issue of the <i>Weekly Times</i>. Stereotypers were testing
the pneumatic steam tables. Pressmen under Old
Horney&rsquo;s direction oiled the double-deck rotaries and
tightened bolts.</p>
<p>At last came the moment when the starter plate was
fitted into place on the cylinder. With a half turn of
a T wrench Old Horney made it secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; he announced, flashing the signal
light. &ldquo;You push the button, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Trembling with excitement, she started the press
rolling. Faster and faster it went. In a moment papers
dropped so swiftly from the folder that her eye could
not follow. A conveyer carried them upward over the
presses to the distributing room.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker offered Penny a paper, smiling as he saw
her stare at the nameplate. Instead of the <i>Star</i> it read:
<i>The Weekly Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no mistake,&rdquo; he corrected. &ldquo;This is your extra.
Your name appears as Managing Editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was why DeWitt was so agreeable to all my
suggestions?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I might have guessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, while newsboys cried their wares, Penny and
her father sat in the private office, talking with Matthew
Judson. From his own lips they learned how he
had submitted to blackmail rather than disgrace
Pauletta by returning to prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your case is a deserving one,&rdquo; Mr. Parker told him
kindly. &ldquo;I assure you we&rsquo;ll never publish the story, and
I&rsquo;ll do everything in my power to help you obtain a
pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving the office, Mr. Judson promised
Penny he would tell his daughter the truth, allowing
her to break her engagement to Major Atchley if she
chose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go away somewhere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;California,
perhaps. Although I&rsquo;ll never try to publish a paper
again, at least my life will cease to be a torment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone with her father once more, Penny had two
requests to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name them,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get Tillie Fellows a job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you take Horney into your own plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to do it as soon as the <i>Star</i> operates
again. Until remodeling work is completed I have no
plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, Dad. This building is yours if you
can make arrangements with Mr. Veeley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! You&rsquo;re willing to give up the <i>Weekly</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willing?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hilariously crazy to
get rid of it. Matters have reached a state where either
I must abandon the paper or my education. I&rsquo;ve only
awaited a chance to end my career in a blaze of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blaze expresses it very mildly,&rdquo; smiled Mr.
Parker. &ldquo;In all modesty, let us say a conflagration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why be modest?&rdquo; grinned Penny. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
come right out and call it a holocaust! That&rsquo;s the
strongest word I know.&rdquo;</p>
